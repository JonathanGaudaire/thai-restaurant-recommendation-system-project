The decor is pink and very cute, it's filled with fresh flowers and very welcoming. 

We ordered 3 kinds of salads, and honestly all were great. I don't like salad in general, but this place changed my mind about it. Unlike salad bars stateside, the bowl was full and the dressing was light and flavorful. My favorite was the one with fake chicken, the balsamic based sauce was sweet and tangy, paired well with the mango bits and walnuts. The fake chicken was just like the real thing.","5 star rating"

My expectations were low, even after entering a very nice looking, if somewhat overly feminine, dining space. The salad menu is huge and it took me several minutes to narrow my choice down to a Mexican salad with grilled chicken. Sigh, at least Brit & Chips is around the corner if this doesn't go well...

Hmm, the salad was excellent! Lots of fresh ingredients and a clearly homemade and tasty vinaigrette. The salad was dressed perfectly with just the right amount of dressing, I honestly can't imagine getting a better salad experience. 

Fellow Yelpers, you know I'm not much of a salad eater, but in the interest of karmic balance I will try to eat one for every trip I make to the poutine place. And if I must eat salad, it will be at Mandy's.","5 star rating"

Lots of seating in a gorgeous environment. We came around lunch and were pleased to see that there was no line. I ordered off the mvp menu (the spicy tuna salad 20.99). We sat and quickly received our meals. Service was quick and friendly. The salad is huge and was super fresh. A bit light on the dressing but I prefer that than overly dressed salads because you can always ask for more!

When I went today it was still closed since we are still during the Covid shutdown of restaurants (so sad by the way) for restaurants and for foodies such has us!

I also love that they have a mini store section where you can wonder around while you wait for your food. 

The menu is amazing if you want to get something healthy but sttill creative and tasty. Their cookies are also really good! 

If you work around this area do yourself a favour and take your lunch break at this Mandy's. It's such a relaxing spot with all the plants and big space!

I ordered ""the fave"" and the hubby had the lumberjack salad. While mine was light and tasty, I preferred his garlic-y dressing to my lime vinaigrette.

They were more than happy to give me a credit to a free bowl of salad. 

So I went back the same week and claimed my free bowl.  They were so cool to offer me any choice of salad bowl and recommended the most expensive salads, the QAISER SALAD ($18.99),  even though I only had the humble Mexican bowl ($12.99).  I've had the QAISER SALAD another time after that on my own dime because it's about as hearty as vegetarian salads can get!  I love the savory mock Shish Taouk chicken.

In the front of the store they sell salad dressings and loads of beverages and snack foods.

I ordered the Mexi Salad with mock chicken. I believe it is mushroom based, or at least that's what my amateur veg taste buds told me. It was delicious!! They bring it to you and while you wait you are surrounded by cute table decor and a stunning view of old montreal. The salad was huge! I was super grateful for that because I'm the kind of girl who does not settle for small salads. #bigsalads #seinfeld 

I had a lovely experience and will definitely be back to try other salads. I was so impressed by the environment and friendliness of staff. It helped that the food was yummy as well! The holy trinity of a good restaurant experience!

And then I remembered that Mandy's had opened a new location in the area (thanks, La Presse!). The location is kind of hidden; I think there's still some renovation on the street and the sign wasn't super visible either.

Once you get inside, you're hit with the wow factor of this place. It's really beautiful and photogenic. You can tell they've put a lot of thought into it. However, the salads are also worth it, in my opinion. I had the Habibi salad ($13.25). Filling and delicious. My cousin had the Tokyo salad ($12.75) and also enjoyed hers quite a bit.

I ordered the Seoul Bowl, which was very tasty and original. I really liked the sauce that came with it. It took a good taste and took it over the top. I'd highly recommend.

My wife had the Mexican salad, which I'd also recommend. The romaine lettuce in this dish was very tasty, and I liked the cilantro/cumin vinaigrette dressing that came with it.

The kids shared the lumberjack salad. To me, this one was seriously lacking in flavor. There just wasn't anything there that differentiates it from any other chain restaurant's salad. The Caesar dressing didn't do much for it, and it simply lacked a lot of flavor.

We arrive, and it's an adorable place with super cute decor and a very friendly staff. I ordered rice noodles with peanut butter tempeh and Tamari sauce. Wow. Wow. And WOWWWW. It was so absolutely delicious that we're going back there RIGHT NOW. I can't get enough.

My boyfriend's Lumberjack salad was gigantic and absolutely perfect!

And the huge chocolate chip cookie I grabbed to save for dessert got devoured on the walk home...it was one of the best I've ever eaten. 

I wish I had a third thumb to rate this place THREE THUMBS UP!!","5 star rating"

I don't want to be sexist but I'd say Mandy's is probably more feminine than male. I mean I would recommend it to my girl friends and maybe not so much to guys. The wifi password was UNICORN, you see? There are pretty flowers on the tables and the menu consists of countless healthy salads. I loved it all. Although... maybe the pink couch in the corner is a bit much ^^ 
The music is cool too and it's spacious so I felt comfortable staying much longer than I needed for finishing my soy latte a yummy choc chip cookie (which was served on a tile! Heavy but cool).

My suggestion would be maybe a piece of French bread to accompany. I would have liked to try a soup but not available in summer. Prices were a bit high as many of reviews mention.

The manager 'Konstantinos' sees me looking around, 'is there a Dog bowl?' I ask he's directs me outside, there isn't one, I then have to ask a waitress who brings one out. He then comes to tell me that the dog water is for paying customers only. Really, what a joke. I then meet my friends and we place our order.

We ordered our salads which, like others have noted, are very expensive. We spent in total $40 for 2 salads (added chicken) and no drink. I would've loved to try one of the absolutely refreshing looking lemonades or strawberry mint (I think?) but couldn't bring myself to spend that much. 

Also if it had been cooler I would've splurged on the bulletproof coffee - sounded amazing!

The service was fast, the waitresses were really friendly, and the atmosphere in general was really calming. I tried their Wolfe bowl and it was incredibly flavourful and full of textures, it was with a creamy dressing, arugula and some other greens, sunflower seeds, brown rice (I'm sure there were other stuff in there too but I'm just trying to make a point that there were variable textures). The bowl is HUGE, and I couldn't finish it (probably that churros I had before lol). One thing though, the flavours were amazing, but I feel like if you eat slow like me, you start getting bored of the taste (especially it was heavy and creamy like my dressing). I'm hoping at least some people relate to that, I get bored of foods halfway through a lot  I would definitely go again though, to try another salad (perhaps with a lighter sauce this time).","4 star rating"

This is a casual dinning place with friendly staff. We went on a Tuesday night; we had called earlier to make a reservation since we were planning on seeing Cirque that night and we were told that they don't take reservations. (Their website said they did.) We got there around 6:20 pm and there was plenty of seating for the 4 of us. After we ordered our food at the register, we went to sit down and we were quickly given both flat and bubbly water for our table. The food came out pretty quickly too. I had the Salmon Sensation, my son had the December special with roasted chicken and my niece had the Mexican salad with chicken too. We all agreed the salads were tasty and not over dressed, with the right proportions of ingredients in our respective salads. Plenty of satisfying ingredients made it for a healthy, and filling meal. My husband who wasn't that hungry had a bowlful of marinated tofu, added some greens from my salad and a berry smoothie. He felt quite satisfied too. I split the Nutella smoothie with my son and  we both agreed when we got back home we would try and duplicate this delicious drink, which included, almond butter, almond milk, Nutella and a banana-all ingredients we typically have on hand.  YUMMY! I just wished we had a Mandy's in California where we live, as I could easily see trying all the salads!  Encore, encore!s is definitely a favorite.","5 star rating"

We also ordered homemade style pad Thai, beef vermicelli.  The pad Thai was dry and  flavourless. I had to use a lot of hoisin sauce. 

The Beef Vermicelli was more like a beef stir fry, which was ok not much taste. 

They make a different type of Fish sauce which is very good. It's more on the sweeter flavour side compared to regular fish sauce where the fish taste is very potent.

It's easy to order, the food is cheap, and it tastes good. It's a great place to stop by if you're in the area and need to have a quick lunch. 

The dessert buns are pretty nice. I love the little designs. They aren't my favorite thing to get, though. I would recommend the green frog one because there's a bit of green tea flavor in the red bean paste. 

My favorite things to get are actually the savory buns. The BBQ pork bun, the pork and Chinese preserved vegetable bun, and the vegetable bun are my favorites. I used to really like the leek, egg and shrimp bun but the last two I've had have had bits of rubber band in them so I don't eat those anymore. 

I also really like the zongzi. Those are the things wrapped up in leaves. They have lots of different fillings and are very fun to eat. 

I usually don't get the combo meals, but the ones I've had were pretty good. It's simple food, but oddly comforting. 

They have bubble tea here. It's not a specialty place but they have all of the standard flavors and it's convenient to get your food and drink from the same place. 

My favorite drink from here is the hot tea with jujubes/Chinese red dates and honey. It's so nice to drink in the winter on the chairs outside. You can eat the dates at the bottom once you've drank it all. 

I might be a little biased about this place because I've been coming here for a long time. I have anxiety and sometimes have a really hard time leaving my house, but I always feel comfortable going to this place, so it has become kind of special to me.","4 star rating"

This place is the cutest bakery at the corner of the street of Chinatown. Upon coming in, it's split into 2 sections: a bread bakery on the left & steamed buns/dim sum/smoothie selection on the right. The cases are filled with some of the cutest steamed buns I've seen. If you love Sanrio (Japanese cartoon characters) like Hello Kitty, Kero Kero Kerroppi, Doraemon, etc. this is the place for you. They also have panda, pig, angry bird, and various animal shaped steamed buns for you to select from and enjoy.

I chose the matcha bun & blueberry bun both with red bean paste. They're both so much more dough than filling. They're served warm to you in paper bags, but the more I kept biting hoping for filling, is just get more dough. You'll also have to pay 25 cents to get a box. Buns vary from $2-2.50. Service was pretty rude.

OMG, this place has steamed buns in cute characters! Love Sanrio characters, such as Hello Kitty and Doraemon? You can find them here. Want a panda steamed bun? Yep, you can get a dozen if you wanted to. 

The cute character steamed buns range from $2 to $2.50. You can also get regular steamed buns that range between $2 and $3.50. This place accepts debit and cash only.

I was mesmerized by how creative this bakery is. As much as I would have liked to have bought one of each, I settled for the chick (mango coconut filling) and the bunny (green tea paste filling). They were adorable.

I had the bunny steamed bun when I got back to my hotel room. The downside is that you get far more dough than filling. It was good.

For breakfast, I changed things up and had the chick steamed bun. It was yummy. I loved it better than the bunny. I simply love coconut and pineapple. Again, you get more dough than filling.

This place also has egg waffles. I was watching a woman brush oil in each egg crater of her waffle maker. It seemed so laborious. Then again, the lineup was so long waiting to get my steamed buns that it was fascinating watching her do it.

You can also order dim sum items to either eat in the place or do takeout. I had already eaten dinner and wanted these steamed buns more, so I passed.

This bakery offers unique creations. I wish we had a bakery like this bakery in the GTA. I loved my visit here.

The place is smack in the middle of Chinatown next to another pastry place that's worth checking out as well. 

Each bao were super cute and huge! The best one is probably the black sesame panda. They have you a good amount of black sesame inside. The blue berry red bean doraemon is the best in terms of the outside bread. It is sweeter than the other baos and I can imagine my younger self eating this while walking to school thirty years ago. Also got the rabbit and the Keroppi looking one. Not a fan. Oh!!the hedgehog porcupine looking one is really good too if you like taro. Yes, taro- not ube. There IS a difference. :)

I got 2 Hello Kitty (custard), a Keropi (the green frog) (red bean), an Angry Bird (chocolate and strawberry), a Hedgehog (taro), and a Yellow Chicken (mango coconut).  The buns actually have very little filling and are mostly just bread, but they are soft and fluffy.  Hey, the truth is I bought them because they are cute and look nice in pictures, not because I thought they would be delicious.  They didn't taste bad, but just nothing special.

All the cartoon buns were $1.99, except the Angry Bird one, which was $2.50.  Prices already include tax. 

This bakery also sells bubble tea and regular buns and pastries.  It's in Chinatown and is similar to other Chinese bakeries in the area (and in Chinatown in Toronto) except they are the only one I know of that make the cute cartoon steam buns.  Oh and they also sell Dim Sum.

I love the hello kitty custard buns here! It's soft and delicious. Buns are relatively cheap around $2 each. I've also tried the melting custard bun. This was actually melting inside. But I prefer the regular custard one better. 

I bought a total of 9 bun at once one time and they stuffed them into the boxes. In one box they put 4 buns. All the buns ended squished and deformed looking. Be careful when you buy multiple buns. You should ask them to bag then separately instead. That might be better than boxing them.

I couldn't pass on this opportunity to eat some cute bao buns so I HAD to try it. Here's my rundown:

Food - 
I'm a sucker for anything taro and really wanted to try their taro paste buns, but I was disappointed that they didn't have these in stock despite coming fairly early on that day. Instead I got the following:
-Frog Bao Bun (Green Tea with red bean paste) - Honestly, I was disappointed with the way this tasted as the green tea tasted poor in its quality and the red bean paste had a weird aftertaste. I wouldn't recommend getting this unless you like cute frogs.
-Chicken Bao Bun (Mango Coconut) - This was better than the frog bao but the mango coconut paste inside was very sweet. Great for people who like sweet things and coconut but the combination with mango was a little off-putting for me.
-Bear Bao Bun (Brown Sugar with red bean paste) - Despite having brown sugar, I thought this was the overall best bao bun. When combined with the red bean paste, the brown sugar actually complements the aftertaste of the red bean. I would get this if you're looking for something to appease your taste-buds rather than your eyesight. 

Atmosphere - 
Not much to say here because there's no dine-in option. You pay for your food and eat around Chinatown or at home. There are a lot of lights in here and it's quite flashy inside. Pretty typical of your Chinese fast food place.

Service - 
Service was ok. No complaints here. They're pretty fast with taking orders and getting the food out which is commendable.

Price -
The bao buns were $2.50 a piece. I really liked how there was no tax on the buns which was good; however, they don't take credit card which is a bummer.

Verdict - 
Food that is better off looking rather than eating. Honestly, if you're expecting great food out of these cute bao buns then you'll be disappointed. They're good filler food and good for a one time thing but as a regular, I wouldn't see myself getting this again. It was a shame I couldn't try the taro paste bun, but out of all the buns I did try, I would recommend the Bear Bao Bun over the other buns.","3 star rating"

I usually drop by right after groceries on St. Laurent to grab a bao or two. 

There is a huge selection of sweet and savoury baos, sticky rice treats, dim sum items, etc. Although the prices are low, I can't help but think that they would have been at least five time cheaper in China. Oh well. 
As with Chatime, Bao Bao Dim Sum can be understaffed, resulting in long waiting times at peak hours. It also happened quite a few times that requested items were no longer available.  

Overall, the shop does a good job at marketing products that would otherwise be difficult to approach by unfamilliar clients. 
It's a nice - and cute - introduction to chinese munchies.","3 star rating"

The dumplings were in my opinion a bit on the pricey side $1 each (4 for $4). Ahhhh Lordy, I can remember getting 4 dim sum pieces in Chinatown Honolulu for $1.75 each. However this is close to twenty years ago so I clearly need to re-calibrate my brain for 20 years of inflation. The flavour was nothing amazing just ordinary. The sticky rice was okay when I brought it home. A very large serving size for around $5. Good pork offering, mushroom in that gooey soya based sauce.

The bao IS big with very little filling. We bought five different bao character cos of the different fillings. We were excited to devour Hello Kitty as our first option. We each took two bites and gave up because it's literally just bao with a pinch of filling in those bites. The boa taste like any other bao, nothing special about it. We also ordered 'Cherng Fun' (and other items on the menu) which is known as steamed noodles. If you grew up eating this, you know it's the fresh steamed noodles, sweet sauce, peanut sauce, and a sprinkle of roasted sesame seeds that makes you smile. OMG, this 'cherng fun' is nothing like that. The noodles were old and a bit hard, peanut sauce is liquidity, and NO SWEET SAUCE (did we travel to a different planet?)!!!

I asked if they had a minimum using a credit card and the cashier said $5, so I ordered a large taro drink instead of a small. When I inserted my chip card she said they only accepted debit (if I would of known I would of ordered a small). No one started making the drink and the 2 cashiers started helping customers behind me. After waiting a few minutes for my drink I realized no one was making it. I asked the cashier who was making my drink and she said someone was. I asked who and only then they started making it. I was told the wrong info, lost money since I used American money (straight conversion), and it took 10 minutes for my drink because the 2 cashiers did not complete my order.

This place is total crap~! I ate here a couple of weeks ago with some friends who live nearby. It was a freezing, lazy kind of day so I thought we ought to have something soupy with other options as there were a few of us. While you can't please everyone, at least try, right?? Another friend recommended this place, saying she'd eaten at their other location and told me what to get but the item was not to be found on the menu at this location, but there was a sign in their window touting ""authentic"" cuisine so we all just ordered whatever seemed appetizing at the time.

We arrived at about 5pm to an empty restaurant decorated like a Zen spa with white-linen tables complete with wine glasses (BYOW if you wish): Buddha statues, incense burning, possibly even a small fountain somewhere, I don't recall. The sign in their window said they were closed but that wasn't the case. It was a blistery-cold day so we figured we'd be the only ones dining but then slowly a party of eight Asians came parading through with balloons and a cake. I figured how bad could it be, right? I WAS WRONG! I should have known when I saw bowls of pho for $10 and vermicelli for $12!

As much as I wanted soup, there was no way I was going to pay for pho at $10, so I went for some dish that I thought was going to be chicken with bamboo on rice in hot pot ($14). I know, it sounded like something I could get in Chinatown but nothing else really appealed to me that didn't sound like a complete rip-off! My friends ordered pad thai (don't ask; $13), another got the four-course meal with four skewers of different meats (one chicken, one beef, shrimp, and prob pork) for $25, and I can't remember what the other got but just as well as I didn't try theirs. 

My dish was AWFUL. There was ZERO flavour in it and no sauce in the toppings whatsoever so it was this dry pile of a few shreds of tasteless chicken (old, brown meat) and bamboo on top of rice that crusts from the hot pot. There was no appropriate sauce to go with this thing so I just ate what I could. My friend loved her pad thai which came with a fried spring roll and fish sauce, but she's also never had Viet food (not that pad thai is a Viet dish) so I guess the exotic factor had her swooning. I tried some and the noodles were overcooked and the only flavour I could detect was soy sauce! I didn't say anything to set her straight because really, if she's happy with it, who was I to tell her otherwise? Even still, what was up with the odd combination of the soy sauce pad thai with the spring roll/fish sauce?? Our other friend's meal came with a choice of spring roll or bowl of soup, which was actually a mini bowl of pho, the four-skewers on rice plate, and some warm jelly dessert with coconut milk that I can't recall much more of, and the tea/coffee option which never arrived. The other guy had something or other that was straight out of a Chinese menu. Even the sauces on their table were the kind you'd find in a Chinese resto: hot sauce (not sriracha) and soy sauce. 

Honestly, the meal was a total rip-off, coming out to ~$85 with tax, which is totally unheard of for four people in a Viet resto who aren't ordering things like seafood, or a whole roasted animal. Plus there was nothing ""authentic"" about this place. I don't know if this restaurant means to cater to non-Asians or Viet-food-virgins with its décor and white tablecloths and their sign about ""authenticity"" but even still, I thought since it's located in Brossard where there are tons of ethnics, that it would be more ...real? 

I have noticed a difference in Viet food in MTL vs Toronto and I have to say that I like TO's better but that's not reason to go stinking so badly! Thankfully we brought our own wine and didn't waste anymore money at this place, cos it was just AWFUL.

We arrived at the restaurant, it t was busy, we did not mind waiting as we did not make reservations.  Three members of the staff came up to ask us how many people in our party in a span of 40 minutes. Clearly there was lack of communication among the staff for this to happen and none of them seem to help make seating us any faster. We finally got a table after 40 minutes waiting, we sat down and ordered immediately as we had time to see the menu while waiting for a table.

Then the next two meals took another 30 minutes to arrive. They did not arrive until I was basically finished my meal. Then there was my husband's meal it never came we asked two different waiters twice about it. They had completely forgot to make it.

The portions are generous and delicious and the service is warm and courteous. My wife is of Vietnamese origin and if she's says that this is what Vietnamese food should taste like then I agree and very much enjoy! Hoai Huong offers a wide variety of traditional Vietnamese cuisine (I highly recommend the Banh Xeo and Ho Tieu). Maybe the chef had a bad day. Or maybe the Internet is full of obnoxious elitist foodies who can't resist boasting how Their food tastes better then Ours. . . Either way, Hoai Huong is the perfect Vietnamese neighborhood restaurant for this authentic Vietnamese family (no relation to the owners whatsoever! )","4 star rating"

Papaya salad, chicken satay, gado gado - everything was fresh and well made. The satay in particular was well done.

We found this place on Yelp and decided to come here based on the reviews. 
The first time we came here we had a great experience. The food was delicious and service was extremely friendly!! We loved the spot but were in a hurry so couldn't really relax and enjoy our meal. But we decided we would come again soon! 

A few weeks ago I was flying out for a vacation. My husband and I decided to visit this spot again since we had been meaning to come here since our last visit. We went here all the way from Mont Royal right before my flight. 

This was our first meal of the day, we were both hungry so we ordered a few things for the table. We sat here for an hour, finished our meal and left and within five minutes of leaving the place I compulsively started vomiting. Vomited for thirty minutes and then couldn't even stand without support. I immediately got a fever and started to sweat, so we took an Uber to the hospital only to find out I had gotten severe food poisoning. 

Since my husband had eaten the same food and was unaffected, the only explanation we could come up with was that either it was their house hot sauce. I love hot sauces and spicy food so had asked them for their hot sauce. Or their chicken satay skewer with peanut sauce since he had skipped that as well. 

Regardless of a good past experience here, I would not recommend a place to anyone that made me this sick because of their food.","1 star rating"

I first tried satay brothers at the other location and wasn't a fan.

I decided once in for all that the steam buns needed to be purchased so I got in a little roped line where there was 5 ppl ahead of me. I got 2 buns 2 sandwich and a papaya green salad. Sandwich of the day was a meat sandwich tasted almost like hamburger and a well seasoned kefta. The other sandwich was okay but lacking meat.

They can and will eliminate items for dietary reasons. That and a local IPA on tap was a perfect treat for hubs and I to share on a rainy, romantic autumn day. 

They also offer buns and satay (obviously) of all kinds, even tempeh for a veg friendly option and of course papaya salads. It all looked delicious.

I was pretty disappointed with the laksa. the noodles were clearly far from fresh- as they were short and quite chewy, contrary to traditional soft and long laksa noodles, and also mostly consisted of bean sprouts. It lacked the undertones of spice and flavor laksa has and was quite plain. The chicken skewers were pretty good. They had flavor, but were far from extraordinary. Although the sauce that came with it really made the dish much better. it was also served with cucumbers which i though were a good touch.

Well, nestled away in one of the stalls is a super popular Indonesian/Malaysian/Singaporean spot, Satay Brothers. They've become so popular that they have an actual restaurant in St. Henri (about a 5 minute walk away) that's open for dinner when the market shuts down.

Hours coincide with the market although they're closed Monday and Tuesday. First time I came, they were closed but that just meant I could take pictures in peace. Drink menu - interesting that you can order pitchers. Perfect for summer drinking. Even though they have a paper menu, the board menu reflects actual prices.

The stall is very laid back and the guys working there are very cool. We sat at the two counter seats on the side and got to chat with some of the workers, which was pretty entertaining. Even when they were shutting things down to move to the restaurant, they didn't rush us. Heck, they gave us some chicken satay skewers on the house.

- Calamansi lemonade ($3.50)
- Green papaya salad ($8.00)
- Laksa lemak ($11.50)
- Chicken satay skewers

I can't really think of any other places in town that specialize in south-east Asian cuisine so you'll have to make due with Satay Brothers to get your fix. Not a bad way to end my trip!","3 star rating"

This place is definitely not an authentic satay place, the taste has been modified to fit the local people.
Ordered the laksa, it has the same taste, bland and not rich as normal laksa should has.
Also ordered the pork bun, came with two portion, the pork is too sweet, not my favorite.
They open until 5pm, and offer tap local beer.

Singaporean/Indonesian/Malay is a great meal when I can find a restaurant that serves it in it's fragrant, flavourful and spicy manner. Here at Satay Brothers the vibe is low key. It's basically a summer food court whereby you eat at communal picnic tables. I'm cool with that as it's summer and your eating under a tent and there's are scents of food in the air. Very laid back. 

For lunch I had ordered the laksa, 3 satay sticks and a papaya salad. I was really looking forward to a great meal but was seriously underwhelmed. The laksa although looked great was lacking in some flavour. The chicken satay although you could taste was marinated in coconut milk the peanut sauce was bland. The papaya salad was probably the best out of everything but again Paris Pho does a better version. As others have mentioned portions here are a tad on the smaller size. The 3 satay sticks are seriously a joke as they are some of the smallest satay skewers I've ever seen. For me overall the food was a 2.75 stars. They could use a bit of galangal, ginger, lemongrass and Thai birdseye chilies to give it more flavour. I respect however that this is their gameplan and I'm a mere observer. 

If you have the opportunity and want to check out what I consider top notch Malaysian/Indonesian food to check out is Restoran Malaysia in Richmond Hill. Or one of the many Banana Leaf restaurants in Vancouver. In Montreal however there is not a huge amount of Indo/Malay restaurants so they can get away with smaller portions and charging a bit more. My next place I need to check out is Gado Gado. Overall it's okay I was just expecting so so much more!","3 star rating"

The service is incredibly amazing!!!! We went to the market to get some fruits & vegetables and we decided to stop by satay brothers in the booths there and get some lunch.. it was a really hot summer day and we had out baby with us! We stood in line like everyone else and I was so excited to just place my order! (My favorite is their pork buns) anyways we waited for about 2 minutes until one of the staff member came over with  menu and let us order with him!! He was so nice! I was so impressed, he took our order and it was ready so quickly! I felt bad for the rest of line but I'm sure everyone can understand once baby is on board.

We arrived at Atwater market in the late afternoon, so it should have been long after the main lunch rush...but there was still a long queue of people waiting for their satay goodness! I'm glad we joined the line as this was a truly delicious snack!

I thought I wasn't very hungry so I tried a chicken satay stick and a pork bun. They were both really good, although maybe a little small...once I tried them I felt like I could have eaten double that amount. Oops. My husband went for the satay sandwich, which was better value and turned out to be huge and gorgeous. 

My advice for future satay-munchers: Order slightly more than you think you can eat as the line is so long you won't want to go back and order all over again. Even if you're not hungry, their food is so good it will make you want to eat a little more.","5 star rating"

Their food is packed with flavor, as well as simple yet beautifully presented.  With their kind and wonderful sense of humor and kindness, never a dull moment seeing the very hard working guys behind Satay Brothers. 
Their steamed buns, with tender flavorful pork belly, is outstanding. You like some kick? Definitely order their Laksa soup, it packs a great deal of heat, with loads of flavor. A must try!

I first ordered only one satay skewer and one pork bun with a burbon lemonade. The guy who took our order was especially cool and friendly and with all the folks lining up to get a taste - it was definitely an indication that this was going to be good! Well, it was more than good it was EPIC FLAVORS!!!! So much so that we went back and re-ordered more buns and skewers and a satay sandwich: all was amazing. One is NoT enough; trust me!!!

When I say this was delicious it's truly an understatement. This spot is being book marked and we WILL BE back!!!!

Full Stop. Run by two Asian-Polish brothers Matt and Alex who grew up in the hood and know what food needs to be and what is missing from Montreal eats.

They source their meat from the local butcher and use the freshest ingredients. They operate a tight ship of flavor that will have you addicted upon first taste. I remember coming in for the first day this 2012 season and bought the chicken satay (which comes with marinated cucumbers and a to-die-for nut sauce), and Alex gave me a sampling of their Laksa soup. I sat down and was in no way prepared for the intsta-foodboner (WHICH HAS YET TO SUBSIDE ON MULTIPLE VISITS). Since I live in the hood I come fairly often, and not just because Alex has a charm no one can escape. 

Their satays change depending on the day (chicken, pork, shrimp). If you're really hungry go for the papaya salad that is a perfect addition of crunch and acid for the satay. I've never had the steamed pork bun but my friend did and he loved it. If only I wasn't gluten free I would eat their whole menu... in one go.

 Plus, they have a staff of some of the cutest guys in the hood. I don't mind. The thought of them opening a resto makes my whole body full of mini explosions in anticipation. 

Go here! Wait in the crazy line! Just do it. Honestly, it's worth it. So worth it. Plus, what else are you gonna eat? Carbs and carbs?","5 star rating"

First, their satays were grilled to perfection. Very juicy and as requested, extra spicy. Homemade peanut sauce was a nice touch.

By that I mean, it is uncomplicated, inexpensive, delicious and delightful and owners and servers are always cheerful, helpful and just downright awesome.

I confess...I am not a Montrealais, which does not mean that by nature I do not enjoy food. In fact of the matter is I like to graze...kind like a vache Quebecoise! 

Satay Brothers is another little place, dear in my heart now that I've discovered it ...and shamefully so because I do not live the cosmopolitan and incroyable city of Montreal year around...but just visit and return year after year as it is becoming my favourite destination in North America.

Let me cut to the chase...stand in line...just be patient and you will be rewarded with some of the finest southeast asian specialties like satay skewers...there is also a satay of the day...like Pork or chicken, whichever..there is also a fabulous entree soup called Laksa Lemak, spiced to your liking...my friend Michelle got ten spoons of sambal in hers but she is crazily adventurous and likes her mouth to be set on fire.

There are also delightful little steamed buns, with various fillings...the day I visited was pork. In addition there are a handful of deserts but just as a heads up, they sell out quickly...and last but not least there is the popular fresh papaya salad.

So when in the Atwater market area, try something new and support local merchants and these delightful people (owners are brothers Alex and Mat).
The line is less long in early afternoon like 2 pm however, they are more likely to have run out of some of their dishes by then. They are very swift with some dishes while others take a little longer and patience it shall be rewarded :) FYI, they are closed on

Unfortunately I was very disappointed with my experience here. As others have said, portions are small and thus overpriced. Three little chicken skewers (essentially 1-2 bites per skewer) for $8?? One mini-bun (about 3/4 the size of my palm) for $5.75?? Food was decent, but is essentially just grilled food we can make at home. Didn't try the salad or soup, which are undoubtedly more difficult to make and I will update this review if we ever go back and try them. 

Service was also a disappointment; we were smiley and polite, but the cashier was very standoffish and dismissive -- like he was one of the cool kids in high school. Although to be fair, the cashier (one of the brothers) was a lot nicer to regulars/friends, as well as an elderly tourist after us -- I guess we have to be regulars or about 30 years older in order to be treated with a little more kindness. 

I'm not complicated -- I need either awesome service, or good deals to like a place. This place unfortunately did not have either. 

I don't get the hype. At all.","2 star rating"

Despite being dressed super-casually (we weren't planning on fine dining for lunch! And it was crazy hot out and we were walking for miles. NOT pretty!), we were still greeted warmly inside and shown to a lovely table by the front window. I think it was the last available table in the restaurant, as it was lunch-time and hopping. This was obviously a popular lunch place for the downtown weekday crowd. Sharply-dressed waiters were bringing beautifully plated sushi dishes to the tables beside us. My kid was oohing and aahing at each passing dish. 

We chose two inexpensive dishes to share: the California rolls and the tempura plate. It was plenty of food for us to share, and it came with tea, too. We were too full for dessert (and they all looked delish). Our server was very friendly and attentive, and the sushi was fresh and wonderful. What a great place!

The bathrooms were super nice. (I always take note of the bathrooms!). 

Nice touch that they have complimentary, great quality hard candies for the taking.

-miso soup ($5!!): won't recommend
-beef sashimi: very good, but sauce a bit too sweet
-seafood ceviche: delicious, but taste too much lime/yuzu 
-omakase sashimi: HEAVENLY gooooood!! Seven kind of fishes, 2 pieces each for $45. Not cheap at all, but definitively worth it!! 
-seared salmon and unagi sushi: Unagi is a must! So tasty!! 
-miso black cod: very good

Service, however, was really so-so. The waitress was not very knowledgable. I've asked for suggestions and she just gave me a description of a few dishes. She didn't even know which fishes were available on that night. That was very disappointing.

I'm from where sushi is the best place to eat in Japan. I have eaten lots of great sushi including in Canada and this was by far the best I've ever had in Canada. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The portion of fish on nigiri was generous, they used a whole scallop on 1 nigiri! That is quite unusual in Canada.

After dinner, I happened to speak to the chef, he asked me where I was from in Japan and we found out we were from the same prefecture. I told him that the best sushi my husband and I had was in his hometown.

It was the second time to visit this place after I was recommended by my doctor. This is my new favorite restaurant! Next time, I'll try omakase for sure!","5 star rating"

I'll start by saying they have to be the best sushis I've ever had in Canada. 

You enter the restaurant, greeted in Japanese, rooms have a great ambience, intimate candle lit tables. Long bar where you can watch the chef cook. Their house cocktails are delicious. Lychee martini is a must try!

I always order a few starters: carpacchio of the day,  gratin oysters an Kara age this time. Everything was phenomenal beside the karaage which just tasted like popcorn chicken...

Getting past that we received a few roll which I've mostly forgotten: we try the Kamikaze everywhere we go. I remember loving all of them and one of the beaver roll. Perfect amount of petrified fish on to top.

They had an everything matcha night and we shares a matcha cake roll filled with very light cream and sweet Rice puff.

I would recommend this place to others

I lived in Japan for quite a while and ever since I came back in Montreal, I couldn't find any sushi restaurant that was equivalent to the ones in Japan.
And then I found Saiko.
The fish was very fresh, the flavour was incredibly delicious and the food presentation was beautiful! I was getting teary. 
Although we waited a little long, it was definitely worth it.
Nice decor, nice staff. This restaurant needs more popularity. It's a great place to go if you are not afraid to try new meals.

Japanese culture is seriously getting popular in Montreal and I am so glad we are getting REAL authentic cuisine by REAL Japanese cooks. (No offence to cooks from other nationalities)

Saiko is without a doubt amongst my Top 3 sushi restaurants in Montreal. The nigiris are absolutely amazing and the quality of the fish is irreproachable. Some of the fish is imported from Japan. 

Your best bet would be to do an omakase dinner and let Chefs Yusa-san and Shin Ichi-san know your preferences. Do not be shy and ask which fish is freshest on the day that you are there. Do not skip on the dessert, especially if you love green tea.  

My wife and I have been here a few times and are surely about to become regulars. We always had good service, even when we were in a large group.

Before I came here, I didn't know much about this restaurant. Indeed, Saiko does not receive nearly as much buzz as some other sushi restaurants in the city. I first came with no expectations. It is now one of my favorite spots.","5 star rating"

I'm not a maki person so I had mostly Sushi and Sashimis. The fishes were super fresh! Our waiter, aka owner took the time to explain their menu and where the fishes came from.

I had the chirashi and matcha cheesecake, both made me cry from happiness. Fresh fish, beautiful presentation, good texture of cake (soft and creamy and not too green tea-y or bitter or too sweet) and absolutely phenomenal service and nice ambiance. I enjoyed my experience there and will be coming back for sure for sure!

I really recommend the two dishes I mentioned before. Chirashi, if you didn't already know, is sashimi on a bed of sushi rice. It came with a ring of beautifully sliced avocado and a shiso leaf on top. Great variety of sashimi from hotate, sake, squid, etc. Just beautiful...

It is definitely more on the expensive side, but seriously...if I had a lot of money to spend, I'd come here every other day and be a regular. But nope, most of us do not have that luxury.

It's the only restaurant in that strip that's open at night, and was recommended by a client. The entire staff is Japanese, and you might wonder why that matters, but only until you've been to a different sushi joint where the guy behind the sushi bar was a tall redheaded farmboy and the sushi was just what you'd expect from that kind of a guy (ran into this in Kentucky, not a hotbed of sushi).

The manager himself made me up some sangria (not a normal staple in a sushi joint), and it was fantastic. Yeah, it's hard to screw up, but this was good. Their miso soup was good. Hard to screw that up too. I ordered the Duo, which is a mixed bag of maki and nigiri put together by the chef. When it was brought out, the manager explained to me what all I was eating. He pointed out the one kind of sauce you use for the maki, and the other for the sushi. There was one item he said to eat without any sauce. Wish I'd saved that for last, since it was incredible. 

Price was pretty good, $28 for the Duo, service was good, although it wasn't crowded. Highly recommend. Quick walk from the Marriott Chateau Champlain, which is a great hotel as well.","4 star rating"

I went in expecting the place to be busy as it was a Thursday night. But upon arrival, the only people there were me and my girlfriend. Ignoring the fact that the place was practically dead, we ordered.

We ordered three different nigiri's and upon taking the first bite, the rice tasted under cooked. The chicken skewers were average and so was the gyoza. The ""my life"" beef had a lot of vain's making it hard to chew and eat. We didn't order anything else, but from the things we ordered, the food is definitely not worth it's price.

The server that was serving us gave us looks when we asked about the things on the menu and overall seem quite busy Chinns Ginger did you fall

Being used to eating more or less authentic asian food, I was skeptic about this whole 'general tao' thing, but I trusted him, and went for the MAYO CHICKEN (sorry Khai :') )

The cashier warned me about its heaviness, but I was starving, so I ordered it anyway. The mayo chicken came battered and fried like general tao chicken, but with a mayonnaise sauce. The batter was rather thin and there was a good amount of chicken in every piece. But the sauce was SUPER SWEET - so sweet a little more sugar would convince me I was eating timbits with a little rice and a little salad. Speaking of salad, I like how they use sesame oil as dressing. Not to mention that the cashier was totally right, the meal was very heavy on the mayonnaise, and it wasn't even as good as the mayo chicken at Keung Kee. 

Another friend tagged along, and ordered the Soo Guy chicken. It wasn't as greasy, but it was sweet. The sauce for this kind of fried chicken was a mix of ketchup and cherry sauce, or at least that's what it tasted. 

We also ordered peanut butter wontons... Wontons were good... the peanut butter sauce was very average. 

While dining, all the other customers were non asian, and they all ordered a hot tom yum soup, which makes me believe that maybe I deserved a slap in the face for ordering food that I knew I probably wouldn't like (American chinese food is far too sweet for my liking), and I should have went for a soup that ACTUALLY exists in some parts of Asia (Thailand).","4 star rating"

First off, the DECOR is amazing!  Really cool and minimalist, extremely unexpected for this area.  You can see every design detail was thoughtfully considered.  
Secondly, and very importantly, the MUSIC was great (minimal and non-vocal), best I've heard in a resto in ages! 
If I was rating the ambiance, Maneki would rate 5-stars for sure. 
But now the food: I ordered chicken fried rice, a basic dish but unusual for me to order (wasn't in the mood for something oily and saucy, and couldn't have anything breaded as I can't eat wheat), it was overly salty and the overly flavours (or lack thereof) were bland.  The rice itself was a bit undercooked, but no big deal.  What is a big deal was there was hardly any chicken in it, which made for a pretty unbalanced meal (all carbs, barely any protein or veg).  Big disappointment.  
Also maybe a l'utile bit off-putting that you have to tip before receiving your food, and even that you have to tip at all for self-service (order and cash, get your own water and napkins, and clean up your own table). 
All in all however, I have to say I would return with friends to enjoy the superbe ambiance.","3 star rating"

So in terms of food, it wasn't great. 
I had the general tao and my friend had the sesame ginger beef. Both of our dishes tasted the same. Why? Because the meat was coated with so much sweet & sour sauce, it was indistinguishable. The rice didn't taste great either and the salad was just a very random iceberg lettuce side. The price point is passable: 12$ for a take out counter type joint. I had half of my meal to-go because the portions are pretty big. But I didn't even end up eating all of it cause it was just too sweet.

I figure this place would fill up more once school is underway too! 

You place your order at the counter and take a seat for your food is served! I opted for takeout: Pad Thai (or Pad Homa in honour of the neighbourhood) with chicken 11$ and a Vietnamese coffee at 3$. The portion was huge and the food was awesome! Service was super friendly and quick too! 

I especially liked the Vietnamese cold coffee which although I've had before elsewhere, I never enjoyed it as much as the one from this little hole in the wall! 

Literally, a hole in the wall; this venue looks sketch, located in a rundown strip mall across the metro, but the space is bright, clean, cute decor and offers some seating with a very casual setting.","4 star rating"

I ordered their salt and pepper chicken popcorn which came with white rice and iceberg salad and unfortunately, I wasn't impressed...at all. My dish was bland and tasteless,  I could have ordered the exact same thing at a random food court's Tiki Ming.

Being used to eating more or less authentic asian food, I was skeptic about this whole 'general tao' thing, but I trusted him, and went for the MAYO CHICKEN (sorry Khai :') )

The cashier warned me about its heaviness, but I was starving, so I ordered it anyway. The mayo chicken came battered and fried like general tao chicken, but with a mayonnaise sauce. The batter was rather thin and there was a good amount of chicken in every piece. But the sauce was SUPER SWEET - so sweet a little more sugar would convince me I was eating timbits with a little rice and a little salad. Speaking of salad, I like how they use sesame oil as dressing. Not to mention that the cashier was totally right, the meal was very heavy on the mayonnaise, and it wasn't even as good as the mayo chicken at Keung Kee. 

Another friend tagged along, and ordered the Soo Guy chicken. It wasn't as greasy, but it was sweet. The sauce for this kind of fried chicken was a mix of ketchup and cherry sauce, or at least that's what it tasted. 

We also ordered peanut butter wontons... Wontons were good... the peanut butter sauce was very average. 

While dining, all the other customers were non asian, and they all ordered a hot tom yum soup, which makes me believe that maybe I deserved a slap in the face for ordering food that I knew I probably wouldn't like (American chinese food is far too sweet for my liking), and I should have went for a soup that ACTUALLY exists in some parts of Asia (Thailand).","4 star rating"

First off, the DECOR is amazing!  Really cool and minimalist, extremely unexpected for this area.  You can see every design detail was thoughtfully considered.  
Secondly, and very importantly, the MUSIC was great (minimal and non-vocal), best I've heard in a resto in ages! 
If I was rating the ambiance, Maneki would rate 5-stars for sure. 
But now the food: I ordered chicken fried rice, a basic dish but unusual for me to order (wasn't in the mood for something oily and saucy, and couldn't have anything breaded as I can't eat wheat), it was overly salty and the overly flavours (or lack thereof) were bland.  The rice itself was a bit undercooked, but no big deal.  What is a big deal was there was hardly any chicken in it, which made for a pretty unbalanced meal (all carbs, barely any protein or veg).  Big disappointment.  
Also maybe a l'utile bit off-putting that you have to tip before receiving your food, and even that you have to tip at all for self-service (order and cash, get your own water and napkins, and clean up your own table). 
All in all however, I have to say I would return with friends to enjoy the superbe ambiance.","3 star rating"

But the inside is very well tended to--decorated conceptually and in good taste. Like the other reviews stated, it's very ""insta-worthy"". However, this is Yelp! So in terms of food, it wasn't great. 
I had the general tao and my friend had the sesame ginger beef. Both of our dishes tasted the same. Why? Because the meat was coated with so much sweet & sour sauce, it was indistinguishable. The rice didn't taste great either and the salad was just a very random iceberg lettuce side. The price point is passable: 12$ for a take out counter type joint. I had half of my meal to-go because the portions are pretty big. But I didn't even end up eating all of it cause it was just too sweet.
In summary, let's just say if the cashier wasn't nice and the restaurant wasn't so awesomely decorated, this experience would have been similar to a mall food court.","3 star rating"

1) It's SO COLD in here. I cannot stress this enough, hence the 3 stars.

I can't focus if all I can think about is wanting to be next to a heater...! If you come here, especially to study for a longer period of time, wear many layers and bring a scarf.

2) I ordered a hot chocolate and while the presentation was beautiful, it was sort of watery/had no flavor. Considering it costs about $5, I expected a rich consistency. Disappointing drink, would not recommend or buy again.

It was recommended to me and one taste and I was hooked. So hooked, in fact, that I recently visited Montreal after 5 years of not being there and a Santropol cream cheese sandwich was one of the things I looked forward to most. Seriously, I think I talked about the sandwich for a solid week before I even visited the city.

When I finally got there with my friend, I couldn't contain myself. We both got Killer Tomato sandwiches. She got a coffee and I got a spiced apple juice. 

The sandwich was as good as I remembered and according to my friend, I grinned the entire time I ate it. My friend also enjoyed it and I was worried I overhyped it but she confirmed it was as good as I said. The key is the fresh baked bread that is so fluffy and amazing and pairs perfectly with the flavourful cream cheese. The fresh vegetables, provide a nice crunch to the sandwich. It really is the perfect cream cheese sandwich and while that seems like it is not something you may need in your life, one bite or this and you'd realize you definitely do. 

I have tried some of their other sandwiches and all are delicious, not just the Killer Tomato. My second favourite is the Pepper Island but really you can't go wrong with anything.

The other thing I should mention is that, while I don't personally drink coffee, my brother-in-law is obsessed and since I've been at McGill, I've had to bring bags of Santropol coffee back to Toronto for him. So there's that.","5 star rating"

Staff is kind, service is quick and efficient. Also, I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was delicious. Very filling / generous portions -- I was full after eating only half and the small salad on the plate. 

However, I had 2 main problems during my visit:

1) It's SO COLD in here. I cannot stress this enough, hence the 3 stars. My nose and hands are freezing to the touch despite wearing leggings under my jeans, a turtleneck, sweater, and having my coat on (I'm not the only one). I can't focus if all I can think about is wanting to be next to a heater...! If you come here, especially to study for a longer period of time, wear many layers and bring a scarf.

2) I ordered a hot chocolate and while the presentation was beautiful, it was sort of watery/had no flavor. Considering it costs about $5, I expected a rich consistency. Disappointing drink, would not recommend or buy again.

Overall I do love the cafe, their logo and the vibe is cute/cozy, but just be aware of the cold + get a different hot drink","3 star rating"

It was recommended to me and one taste and I was hooked. So hooked, in fact, that I recently visited Montreal after 5 years of not being there and a Santropol cream cheese sandwich was one of the things I looked forward to most. Seriously, I think I talked about the sandwich for a solid week before I even visited the city.

When I finally got there with my friend, I couldn't contain myself. We both got Killer Tomato sandwiches. She got a coffee and I got a spiced apple juice. 

The sandwich was as good as I remembered and according to my friend, I grinned the entire time I ate it. My friend also enjoyed it and I was worried I overhyped it but she confirmed it was as good as I said. The key is the fresh baked bread that is so fluffy and amazing and pairs perfectly with the flavourful cream cheese. The fresh vegetables, provide a nice crunch to the sandwich.

It's a cute place where you can come and study or hang out with your friends. It's super comfortable and the customer service was good! It gets packed easily though so I would suggest coming here a bit early because there was a huge lineup where people had to wait to get a table. Since it was super busy, the waiters took their time coming to us and getting our orders (we had to wait a long time to tell the waiters our order we had to eventually call over someone and tell them we're ready). But we got our food fairly quickly and it was super good! My friends got the CBLT and Park avenue and they both liked it. I got the killer tomato sandwich and I replaced half of the sandwich with the soup of the day which was amazing. It was this lentil soup and it had lots of vegetables in it (my favourite were the olives I'm a die hard olives fan) but it wasn't bland or anything it had a nice taste to it and I enjoyed it a lot. The sandwich was phenomenal as well! It was a red pepper cream cheese and had tomato slices (hence the name lol) and I found that it was a really good combination. I'm not usually a big veggie sandwich fan but I truly liked it and the rest of their menu looked tasty as well so I would definitely come back and get another type of sandwich.

The owner of said dog had no consideration for the animal nor the patrons who had to either tip-toe around the canine or step over him.

After the large pit bull bit me, I went inside to wash my bloody arm in their washroom, but the manager refused to speak to me nor to identify the dog owner who was still in the restaurant, as she claimed, ""there is a lunch rush and I'm super busy.""

The restaurant wasn't even close to full and it was the mid-afternoon. She did offer water but said that even her staff were far too busy to help in any other way. She didn't even want to have the dog moved to protect other patrons as she said, ""he looks calm now, he'll be fine.""

After opening a case with the Montreal police and sharing photos of the dog owner (who eventually came out to bribe me not to report the attack, which I refused), the manager came outside to put on a show for the police but didn't apologize nor help identify the owner (who just paid her bill at the cash where the manager was working.)

The patio in the back is one of my favourite places to hang out during summer, with the fairy lights and all the greens. 

Their sandwiches, although relatively pricey, are the bomb. They are HUGE, very healthy (lots of vegetables) and served on pumpernickel bread (my favourite is the mango one).

First, the restaurant is deceptively large.  It is much bigger than it looks from the outside. There is plenty of seating inside, but the patio is gorgeous on a summers night and I highly recommend sitting out there if it is available.  
They have a full coffee/tea/espresso bar.  We had several in our party get lattes which they were happy with.  We had a couple of lemonades and two chai.  Neither of us were impressed with the chai.  It seemed bland, almost watered down.  
The restaurant serves a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches.  We shared a vegetarian chili which was a large portion and had great flavor.  The sandwiches and salads are all vegetarian friendly, but if you are a meat eater like me you can add ham to your sandwich.  I had the mango madness and it was out of this world.  It had ham, cream cheese, and spicy mango chutney on this beautiful brown bread.  The sandwich came with a small salad, but the sandwich was quite large and delicious, so I ate most of the sandwich and decided to forgo the salad.  
We also sampled a few desserts including a raspberry cheesecake and key lime tart, both of which were awesome.  
If I am ever in Montreal again I will likely return.","4 star rating"

I was really disappointed. The service is really not good - I spent about 15 minutes standing next to the ""LET US SEAT YOU"" sign and the wait staff kept ignoring me, which was weird. 

Then I had the Sweet Roots sandwich which just tasted very earthy (sure, it's root veg) but the bread was earthy too... I don't know, for the price I expected big flavour. 

I probably won't come here again :(","3 star rating"

The place generally looks nice and cosy but seriously, the food is horrible. I ordered a vegan sandwich which was basically apple and carrot grated over two pieces of brown bread. They gave me a side of salad which was basically grass. No dressing or even olive oil. They sat me outside near some water area which was breeding mosquitoes. There's so much mosquito in their garden, I don't know how they got approved for hygiene. It's really unhealthy and unadvisable to sit your customer next to a mosquito breeding ground. The service is also not that great, they make you wait really long time for something as simple as filter coffee. The place isn't clean either. There were stains in my napkin  and the cutleries needed to be wiped. Additionally , they are using 
 ""vegan mayonnaise"" to sell air because I ordered a sandwich with vegan mayo and it was so dry that even California looks flooded in front of it. The menu says the place has a historic significance in Montreal and I am all up for that but they should really put an effort to serving customers. I really don't know why this restaurant still runs because honestly they're  exploiting their customers in the name of preserving a neighbourhood building. This is peak Montreal white hipster vibe. They would buy anything that appears down trodden but in truth, is really expensive for its value.","1 star rating"

I would describe her but I think if you were there you would know whom I speak of.

If you are the manager or the owner of this place, she seems like the smallest one there out of the girls that work there, she is terrible not nice at all. Everyone one else seemed really nice.

The service is HORRIBLE and the food is overpriced and lacklustre. When I walked in I waited in the area that said ""please wait to be seated,"" however the waitresses kept walking by my friend and I without acknowledging us. After around 3 minutes of waiting a woman came from behind the counter and gave us menus, and didn't say a word or seat us. My friend and I eventually got the message that we should seat ourselves, and ventured inside the restaurant. The waitress that came to take our order wasn't great either, she just took our orders and gave us our food without coming by to check on us. I was parched the entire time and desperately needed a refill on my water, however the waitress was nowhere to be seen for the rest of our visit. The restaurant was nearly empty when I went and there was really no excuse for the poor service. I've been to Santropol three times before and the service has been bad in the past, but after this visit I will definitely not be going here again. 

In regards to the food, it's just OK. A ham sandwich with cream cheese, lettuce, mango chutney, and a SMALL salad, should not cost 14 dollars. Period. The sandwich is mostly bread and the crust is extremely hard. I would honestly be better off just stopping at Subway and eating my sandwich at Jeanne Mance park.","2 star rating"

However, the selection and flavors you can find here cannot be easily recreated at home.

More than once I've brought out of town guests here and they always, without fail, are impressed with the food, the presentation and the atmosphere. The garden in the back is by far the best place to sit during the hot summer months but the seats inside are just as cozy in the winter time. 

Prices have been steadily going up over the years but the place still somehow manages to rely that hippy-Boho vibe it's always had.  I'm not going to tell you which sandwich to get, my favorite changes constantly over time but you can't go wrong with the traditional flavors. Their originals have some unusual combinations here but they are always quite tasty like the Killer Tomato, Sweet Root and Pepper Island. I know I'm weird in saying this but sometimes it's the basic ingredients in the construction of any one dish is what either makes it or breaks it and in this case , it's the bread. No joke.

Basically all the sandwiches have cream cheese as a main ingredient. I ordered the veggie pate sandwich with tomatoes and had a cup of gazpacho with it. The gazpacho was huge and pretty good, but the sandwich was not very tasty. I found that there was too much bread, and the veggie pate didn't have the best flavour. I didn't finish it, despite being really hungry when I arrived. Also, the bread was dry and not toasted.

The Hubster had a chicken salad sandwich, which he said was pretty underwhelming. He was pretty put off by the fact that they don't serve alcohol.

First, if you can you have to sit on their beautiful terrace. It is colourful, fresh and a laptop free zone. Enjoy the koi pond and the greenery as you eat light and refreshing food. The first time I ever went on a Saturday evening, we also enjoyed live music from a fun little indie group.

Their sandwiches are big, and they offer you the choice to substitute half your sandwich with a soup. I ordered the CBLT as I am a huge fan of coconut bacon, and substituted half my sandwich with a sweet potato and almond butter soup. The soup was velvety smooth and tasty. The sandwich came with a little bit of salad and was delightful. Cafe Santropol is definitely my top pick for when I'm craving a sandwich.

We sat on the outdoor patio because the weather was excellent.  I started with the spicy carrot-apple puree soup... something I was unsure about at first but it sounded better than the vegetable soup.  It turned out to be delicious.  I followed this up with the ""Pepper Island"" sandwich, with pesto cream cheese, chicken salad, and chopped peppers (a replacement for the missing jalapeno jelly).  Trust me when I say that mere mortals do not need a full sandwich portion if you get soup.  A half portion should be plenty, and you will not hate yourself afterwards.

Wash it all down with one of their special soda floats.  I went with the maple-spice soda float.  I felt like I was drinking soda water that had been hypersaturated with maple sugar infused sugar and topped with a scoop of ice cream.  It was amazing.

I remember discovering this place with its charming back patio green oasis in the heart of the Plateau almost twenty years ago, and have gone back every time I return to Montreal since. Anyone I've ever taken there for lunch is happy with their meal, which is pretty much a giant sandwich on fresh pumpernickel bread and either a soup or salad.

 The sandwich options are pretty unique and it's hard to make a decision about which one would be the most interesting and delicious. I always opt for smoked salmon. I would recommend that if not ordering the smoked salmon, then get the chicken salad addition to the sandwich, otherwise you're looking at a lot of bread and cream cheese with other accent toppings, like nuts or spreads. The chicken salad is divine and they'll add it to any sandwich. The soups are ALWAYS good - typically a lentil-based option or a gazpacho.

The interior of the cafe is filled with the heavenly aroma of bread, but my friends and I opted to sit in the outdoor garden, wanting to take advantage of the fleeing warm weather. 
It was a slightly chilly day, but there were heaters and also blankets available. The outdoor garden is beautiful and cozy, and includes a small pond (with fish!) as well as a super colorful and gorgeous hammock. I can just imagine coming here on a hot summer day, sipping on some coffee and reading a book, and relaxing in the hammock - seems like a perfect escape for a day!
The servers were very friendly and helpful with recommendations. The food is super delicious as well. I got the half and half special, so I got half of the Chaucer sandwich (tofu) and a bowl of rutabaga honey soup, and both were really good.

We sat outside in the lovely courtyard terrasse, and it was as pretty as always - perhaps prettier, even, with a cobalt blue fence with happy yellow details, a small central garden with small statues, and strung lights from the trees. Intimate and pretty. The restaurant interior is as warm as it was 30 years ago, with various sections and two central washrooms (the latter are small, unisex, and be forewarned: the door on one washroom never closes or locks. Yikes). Embossed metaled coffered tiles line the ceiling and walls, with large, opened garage door ""windows"" and overhead fans in the summertime, creating a breezy space. 

The menu is still great, with humongous cream cheese-based sandwiches made from fresh bread. I was saddened to see that my ""Sisters of Jeanne Mance"" sandwich was no longer offered (it was my old standby), but thankfully they still had the ""Northern Lights"" (with olives. A family favorite!), and they had some new offerings which were delicious: the ""No. 6.5"" with bananas and black currents and honey was amazingly delicious! And my youngest kid had the ""Mango Madness"" which she loved (she said it was a bit spicy, though - and very messy! But she ate the whole thing). The cauliflower and cheddar soup was a bit bitter, and my kids said it had a bit of an off aftertaste, but they doctored it up with a bit of sugar and then said it was great. The accompanying side salads were small but good, and the salad dressing was excellent.

For dessert we shared the carrot cake, and it was a moist as I remember. It could have used a bit more icing, but it was delicious. And the chai latte and the cafes au lait were wonderful, and presented beautifully in pretty glasses with fruit as garnishes. In fact, all the dishes were plated and presented beautifully, with lovely fruit garnishes.

Our server was nice, despite her manning many tables, we didn't have to wait long at all. 

Parking on the street can be problematic, so I recommend going at off times.

This restaurant is truly a gem. I can't recommend it strongly enough.","5 star rating"

It's beautiful and peaceful. You forget you are in the city!

I order the St. Urbain sandwich with chicken salad (they were all out of the Killer Tomato which is what I really had my eye on). The sandwich was tasty, and the bread and salad fresh. I only ate half of the sandwich and my salad so the portions are quite big. 

No decaf coffee or espresso was a bummer. 

Worth the visit if you are in the area and looking for a fresh meal.","3 star rating"

This spot literally has EVERYTHING you could ever want from a Cafe -- Fantastic coffee and drinks, homemade soups and chilis, delicious sandwiches (on thick bread with custom cream cheeses), loaded salads and delectable cakes. 

In the past, I've tried and loved: 
1. Tuna salad - Ask for extra dressing on their salads. I always feel like there isn't enough. 

2. Killer tomato sandwich - Sundried tomatoes, basil and tomato. I added roast beef

3. Carrot cake - Most likely the best carrot cake I've had in my life. Unbelievably moist... I think there may be pineapple chunks or something in the batter. The slice is massive so you could easily share with someone and both be satisfied. There is juuuust enough cream cheese icing so it's not heavy but you get some with every bite. 

4. Soups - I hesitate to name specific ones because they change them daily. Between the vegetable soup, Thai curry chicken and chili, I've loved them all so I would recommend whatever their daily special is! 

5. Drinks - I love their Americanos, chai lattes and the Santropol herbal iced tea (pomegranate juice with hibiscus tea) 

In the summertime, they have ample seating between the indoors and outdoors. There are plenty of plugs along the wall if you want to do work on your computer. Enjoy!","5 star rating"

1.I have yet to see any member of the staff smile, not exaggerating. I often I want to apologize for making them have to work. Not a good feeling

2. The water they bring to the table is not drinkable, worse than tap water. It is always luke warm and tastes like something you swallowed by mistake. Not sure where they get it....but when you dont drink it they throw it on the plants right in front of you. Not something I need to see FYI. They kinda force you to order a beverage if you want to drink something. I don't enjoy that they use such tactics to get you to spend more of your hard earned money. 

3. The side garden salad is made up of questionable leaves and twigs...looked like they might have been picked right out of the garden, taking the term ""garden salad"" quite literally...I'd rather not see it on the plate than have to pick off questionable twigs and leaves.

4. We were served children sized cups of the iced tea and lemonade that we ordered. While most other tables had the regular size glasses. I guess they might not have had any clean glasses available.  I could have gladly waited. I inquired why they were so small, after all I was being charged the same price as the big glasses, and I was reassured by the annoyed waitress the SAME AMOUNT OF BEVERAGE WAS IN BOTH THE LARGE and the SMALL GLASSES. 

Now, I'm not a genius, not good at math either, but I do know a half a cup is different from a full cup. I finished my 3.00$ drink in TWO SIPS, while other patrons were sipping away for 20 minutes....which further proved my point. 

A nice patio won't be sufficient to keep you going strong in the winter Santropol...work on your attitudes, which means that you may have to smile sometimes even when you don't feel life it...yes, it's part of working with the pubic 101, the quantity of your beverages/ quality of the water and your questionable ""salad"" and maybe you won't find the winter months so long this year.","1 star rating"

I no longer live in Mtl, but anytime I'm in town this place is a must hit 3-4x per week/visit (and given 514's food culture, that's serious business). Fantastic service, amazing atmosphere and best of all, outstanding food. 

Service: staff and menus are bilingual. Service is prompt, courteous, efficient and accomodating. 

Atmosphere: cozy eclectic bohemian, but not stuffy or run down. Great location. The only thing I'd suggest is something to make the wait more pleasant on the nights they get slammed with a line of people that goes all the way out the door - totally worth the wait though!

Food: Huge, satisfying portions, amazing and creative flavour combinations, fresh ingredients, including epically fabulous thickly sliced bread... all at a good value.

I'm honestly fanatical about this place, it's always treated me so well, and I'm sorely missing it right now.","5 star rating"

Located on the corner of St. Urbain & Duluth, in a converted multi-story red brick former apartment building, Santropol is painted with very distinctive pale green and purplish-blue trim that makes it stand out in the neighbourhood. The interior decor is also quite eclectic, including some old-fashioned stamped tin ceilings, a step-down front section with large windows, cozy booths, and an assortment of paintings and wall sculptures.

During the warmer months, their private fenced-in backyard terrasse is a lush garden oasis, complete with full-size trees, a small waterfall and fish pond. At night, it's gently lit with patio lighting and overhead string lights to give a warm and pleasant atmosphere. On Sundays during the summer, you can often hear the distant sounds of drums from the weekly Tam-Tams on the side of nearby Mount-Royal.

The bilingual menus are very veg-friendly, with very large and hearty sandwiches made with Santropol's own dark and thickly sliced bread. Many of the selections lean heavily on the cream cheese, so read the menu carefully if it's not one of your favourites. They often have a selection of two soups of the day; on our most recent visit, I choose the Beef & Barley and was quite pleased with it's belly-warming effect on such a chilly winter evening. During the weekdays, you can substitute half of your sandwich for a soup.

One of my favourite choices is the Minted Ham Sandwich, with ham, cucumbers, thinly sliced apples and sweet mint jelly, served with a light side salad. My dinner companion choose something new for himself, the Mango Madness, with thick cream cheese, sweet and spicy mango and lettuce, with a side salad, which he enjoyed very much.

Santropol offers a nice selection of coffees, teas and other beverages, as well as some delightful milkshakes, available in a multitude of flavours. Their desserts are also quite nice. 

Santropol has free WiFi (courtesy of Ile-sans-fils), which makes it a great place to bring your laptop, catch up on email or other web-related work. The wait staff don't rush the customers, which is a refreshing change from some other cafés that I've been to in Montreal. You'll often see customers working on their laptops, reading the various local indie papers, writing in their journals or even sketching in their art pads. A lovely way to spend the afternoon, either alone or with friends...

All told, Santropol is a true Montreal tradition; one that has both ex-pats and locals returning year after year!","4 star rating"

My real complaint is the exaggerated amount of cream cheese they put in their sandwiches. It is almost nauseating and the bread did not seem as fresh to me. I would go again if I am not hungry only, and just need a tasty (yet overpriced) almond milkshake, or if I have stomachache and in need for a hot soup. Otherwise I prefer my own balcony.","2 star rating"

I ate the northern lights sandwich which was absolutely delicious (enough to share with someone else with a small appetite). My mother ate a special of the day which was a quinoa salad (see my photo). Unfortunately my brother got sting by a bee but the staff was extremely courteous and helpful which showed a lot about the character of this small cafe.

Pretty basic cuisine. We waited for nearly an hour before our food arrived, during which time the servers barely made eye contact with us.

I ADORE this place. Obviously, the summer is the best time to stop by, because hello - terrace. But the last time I ate here was in February, for a birthday lunch. The indoor seating was comfy and cozy and the service was fantastic. Seriously. When I mentioned it was my birthday, the entire staff started looking around for candles to put in some cake. Very sweet.

Okay, the actual food. Their bread is the bread they serve in heaven. I'm convinced. Love love love all the interesting choices of sandwich. Most of which involve some kind of crazy spread that is packed with deliciousness. And lots of veggies. There are a few things you can order with meat, but this place is predominately for the tofu crowd. If you are not part of that crowd, don't worry, you will be at Santropol.

There will tend to be a line out the door in nice weather. Just know that. And know that it's worth the wait.

Costs were reasonable.

I have no complaints about the the actual menu, however the place drops several stars in my book because of poor service - which was somewhere between apathetic and F* You.  The waiter for example, brought 4 forks with our meal (4 people, makes sense right?), but only 2 napkins.  Attempts to flag him down for more napkins resulted in us being visibly ignored.  We ended up getting our own napkins from the inside kitchen.  He never made another appearance at our table after that.  We had to ask how we pay, which I guess we were supposed to infer that we were table #45 to tell the cashier up front.

Well finally went back today and it was one of the loveliest places i've ever been in the city. The Plateau has many gems and this is definitely one that stands out. The Cafe is in a little building - well a house converted into a cafe ! 

The decoration is a mix of vintage & eclectic style - Très a mon goût ! There are many different sitting areas and all the way in the back , theres a magical garden ( yes magical!)  filled with green vegetations, trees and even a little pond. A place where ( in the summer time of course)  you could spend all your mornings - afternoons & evenings ( all day, errrydayyy)  just reading a book, enjoying nature or delighting in philosophical convo's about life. That little magical place even lits up at night to resemble a fairy's den  - or what i imagine a fairy's den would look like if it existed.

Unfortunately we didn't eat any meals there - only a drink and some ice cream. I had an iced coffee late with a hint of mint ( which i asked for) and my friend had vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup and fruits. We thoroughly enjoyed our drink and food and shall go back to sample the main meals and/or entrees.

*Bonus This place sells books for 3$ - which, being a book lover pretty much sealed the deal for me - of course i purchased a book by Albert Camus - & only that one because i didn't have any more change than 3$. Last little amazing surprise , My friend stumbled upon a game of psychology, where you get to ask random behavioural questions - the type that answer to ''what would you do if'' . My friend and i promised to gather up a group of friends and head back there just for that game.

Go there for a date, go there for lunch, go there to spend some time solo, go there with friends...but just go or you will be missing out on this beautiful little gem of a Cafe.

The coffee is fairly traded and organic, also locally roasted and fresh. Soy milk is available for their espresso drinks and chai tea. (Yay!)

For the 2nd time now, the waitress/waiter has given me the wrong order. Today, I ordered my regular Killer Tomato with Ham and gluten free bread (I am intolerant to gluten) and I believed I was given regular bread. I asked my waitress to double check that it was gluten free and she assured me that it was. However, now I am incredibly sick because that bread was clearly not gluten free! Very disappointed and frustrated at this situation. I do not plan on returning here, although I have had good experience with the food.

I ordered the No. 13 (the menus are in French and English, yay!), which is a giant sandwich on brown bread with blackcurrant jam, bananas, honey and cream cheese...and, lettuce.  The lettuce was weird, though overall the sandwich was quite good.  Other reviewers are right, Cafe Santropol is seriously heavy on the cream cheese and it seems to be featured in almost every sandwich. I also ordered a chai soy latte, which was great.  You can tell they actually brew the tea rather than using the prepackaged stuff like most places do.

I lingered far after I was done eating, just enjoying the ambiance on the patio (and yes, fine, eavesdropping on my fellow diners).  I never felt rushed or as though the staff wanted me to leave.  Cafe Santropol would be great for lunch or dinner and would also be a fantastic place to waste a few hours with friends.  If only we had something like this at home...","4 star rating"

It;s even more wonderful when the building has antique pressed tin tiles on the walls and ceiling, the original old wood bar, a sunny back room, and grows their own gigantic sprouts. The vegetables are colorfully selected, crisp and orginally spiral cut.

BUT, a few things to keep in mind. The service is close to abysmal. The boyfriend and I waited a half an hour after we ordered to receive our water and coffee (well, only his coffee arrived), and we would have walked out, except that our food came at exactly the same time. The food itself is tasty but certainly not gourmet - more like your creative college roommate who just discovered that you came put a giant amount of cream cheese on just about everything.  Know that you're going in for a nice sandwich and hopefully a nice seat by a window, nudge the staff (if you can find them) and don't even think about it if you're in a rush.","3 star rating"

I believe too much enthusiasm stems from how cute and unique Santropol is. Certainly looks good from every perspective and offers the luxury of outdoor and covered lunch but the food offer is not that great.

Surely the sandwiches sound appealing with their fruity ingredients but make sure you understand that you will have jelly and not actual fruits. Hence my disappointment: the taste wasn't bad but I felt that the sandwiches were way too sweet. More, although the cream cheese is pretty good, the load is way to heavy and does not combine that well with the jelly. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't bad tasting but I felt that the food would gain in interest by balancing the cream cheese and the jelly more accurately. Furthermore, drinks are okay but still way to heavy and the service was pretty long despite a relatively calm afternoon.

Very Montreal, although not at its best.","3 star rating"

Their terrace has a big tree in the middle and its vegetation and hippie ambiance will give you that zen feeling you are looking for! Also, there's quite a bit of shade (probably created by that big tree) so it's always nice on a sunny day. We went there as a group of 5 and easily found a table. We got their sandwiches and they were huge! Same applies if you get their milkshakes (just saying!). I tried the carrot and tofu sandwiches, and definitely preferred the tofu one. The only thing we found was that it missed some sauce and that it tasted dry.

Whither flow the sandwiches of time? 

I am a big fan of their carroty-raisiny veggie pate and their simple salads. All of their sandwiches are huge - the tuna will feed you for 2 days (if you are 5""2'), but Santropol is really about being the meat between the slices of LIFE that is its atmosphere. 

The stamped tin ceiling, murals, old books and wooden everything along with the beauuutiful leafy backyard make this the kind of place every Montrealer is happy to visit over and over. 
I recommend asking 'light on the cream cheese' if you don't like it to be more than 2 centimeters thick. 
Service wise, it varies. The place is bigger than it looks so the wait is usually justified. Take it in stride and enjoy their secondary function as highly mobile lusting targets.","4 star rating"

This morning some friends from out of town were looking for a sweet place for breakfast, and we finally decided to come here. I've only ever been to Santropol in the past for lunch (killer tomato sandwich, for the win!), so this was a new experience for me as well. Despite being very popular and highly recommended, it is still home to many locals and hasn't lost its special, unique touch. Great service too, our waiter was so nice and helpful.

Being a beautiful, sunny day, we made sure to sit in the lovely garden, amongst the flowers and the cute, little pond. We ordered the Montréalaise and Florentine, both of which were delicious. The bagels tasted fresh and were toasted to perfection, the eggs were cooked nicely, and it didn't feel very heavy. We had an iced coffee to balance out the 25 degree summer sun, while still getting a good pick-me-up made by some great, fair trade, and local coffee.

We split a chocolate cheesecake.  That was pretty good and surprisingly light (almost like a mousse).  My friend had the hot chocolate, and they topped it with whipped cream and fruit (unusual).  She said that was great.

I am not a cream cheese fan so that does limit the menu for me quite a bit - but their non cream cheese options are to die for. 

The place is adorable. What a wonderful little hideaway in the the middle of Montreal. It's very quaint and has the most wonderful outdoor patio (unfortunately since it's Montreal it only gets utilized some of the year). 

All of the ingredients are so amazingly fresh. The sandwiches are served on giant fresh pumpernickel bread. The fixings in the sandwiches are amazing. I used to be a hummus sandwich fan, there hummus is made onsite and is delicious, but then I got turned onto the Sweet Root sandwich. This sandwich is by far my favourite sandwich of all time. It's delicious and so unique. It probably the thing I miss most about living in Montreal and it's the one thing that I always make sure to get when I go back to Montreal to visit.

The drinks are delicious, food is excellent and everything is very fresh. Espresso and tea drinks are served with slices of fresh fruit such as pineapple or orange on the rim of the glass or mug. 

While the menu is somewhat limited, it's worth a visit for the atmosphere alone. Wifi is free, though this probably isn't the kind of spot you can set up shop in for hours.

A diverse crowd was eating here from groups of adults, to families with young children, who enjoyed running around the tables and playing in the pond. Très pittoresque!

Hell, even if you don't like sandwiches you should be eating here because the food is that good.

The vibe is below low key and you might accidentally write a poem or sonnet while you blissfully day dream about fresh baked bread and the goodness that will appear between those slices of heaven. Fear not though because you will be in good company and there are plenty of books to steer you around any writer's blocks you may encounter. If that doesn't help, have a drink or three. The ice cream sodas are wonderful as are their desert coffees.

You will find numerous little odds and ends hiding in every nook and cranny of the back room. From harlequins playing the lute to monkeys in ancient diving helmets playing the stand up bass, there is something for everyone's visual cortex to ponder endlessly.

Santropol loses a start for the slow service, which may have been due to our particular waiter, but still....the bill took forever to come, the waiter said there was no way to coordinate soups arriving with sandwiches (suggested instead that soups may just as well arrive before or after the sandwiches as the kitchen pleased).  It was a busy day to be sure, but more attention would have been nice.","3 star rating"

 I like the homey vibe, the friendly servers and how they tolerated my franglais. I also like the somewhat creepy minarets. They added a touch of magic to my already awesome sandwich.

You know when the bread is fluffy between your fingers, and is slightly crusty on the outside, which gives a textural experience as well as a tasty experience? Welllll, the pumpernickel bread was THAT good. Awesome.

First of all, if you're interested in fiber, don't bother ordering a sandwich with ""brown bread."" It's Wonderbread dough mixed with food dye. The menu offers light fair, but don't fear, carnivores, you can still get those ham chunks on top of your salad. I highly recommend anything with fresh coffee in it; Santropol is well-known for its high-quality, fair-trade and organic coffee production and distribution, and with the roasters located just a dozen blocks away, the cafe can't be lacking. 

The service is casual and friendly, so don't expect anyone to break a sweat bringing you lunch. However they will go out of their way to make you feel like you're hanging out in your own backyard, and recommend anything on the menu. The main highlight of the cafe itself is the garden, complete with slate flagstone paths, bauble lights hanging from overhead foliage and a bubbling fountain. During the cold months it's nice to curl up with a cuppa at one of the tables near the kitchen and catch some of the banter floating between the waitstaff.

Personal favourite is the Killer Tomato (!!!!!). Also a fan of Pepper Island and the classic Santropol. Tried the Sweet Root once, and felt like I was just eating a bunch of carrots between some bread, so won't be getting that one again. That said, if you're a vegan, or a rabbit, or a vegan rabbit, this could be a great option for you.

We ordered standard sandwiches (ham and cheese, roast beef and cheese) but were served anything but ""standard.""  The sandwiches were HUGE.  They were served on monster-sized pumpernickel bread--fresh beyond belief!  The sandwiches were also nicely complemented with a delicious salad.  The menu is mostly sandwiches and soups, all moderately priced for those of us on a tight budget.  Lunch for two cost about $25.

The decor is cozy--a tad bohemian and earthy.  There are a lot of plants and natural light streaming in through the back door and windows, as well as through the skylights.  The waitstaff is friendly and bi-lingual.  So, the next time you're in the city, stop by for a relaxing bite with friends or family.  You'll be glad you did.","4 star rating"

The waiters I've had here have always been really friendly and not demanding... totally cool with you just ordering a coffee and take your sweet ass time.

The last time I was there the waiter asked me if I needed a piece of paper to draw on when he saw me, pen in hand, furiously marking up an article.

For years I stuck with just getting the Killer Tomato sandwich  (cream cheese and sun-dried tomatoes) but have ventured over to the Northern Lights (cream cheese, olives, and roasted pecans) and the Pepper Island (pesto, cream cheese, and jalapeno jelly) in more recent years.  All are delicious but keep in mind you have to be a fan of cream cheese to fully appreciate their greatness (some friends have complained that there is too much for their liking). They also have great milkshakes and coffee.

It tries to look cute with its wooden-y interior featuring random shit on the walls, and crappy old chairs, and it tries to promote green stuff that sounds remotely activisty with its organic coffee and huge sandwiches that taste like the earth and are heaped with vegetables, but none of these things can hide the the basic truth about Santropol cafe: its food is bland and SO overpriced. 

Everytime I have been dragged here by some vegetarian or bike-riding friend of a friend I have been disappointed and ultimately just felt like I would have been better off eating fucking mcdonalds. At least my wallet wouldn't have felt pillaged. Not only was the food at best sub-par, but the service here is some of the most charmless and lazy that I have experience in Montreal - and to single out a place in that city for being the absolute worst is no small comment, which I'm sure anyone who lives there understands. 

My big beef with santropol is that it has to pick an aesthetic. Either it can improve its service and the flavour of its food and keep its price point, or remain a lazy alright-tasting hippy joint but make its menu appropriately cheap. Right now it's just a bum pissing in an alleyway wearing a chinchilla fur coat. wtf.","1 star rating"

i ordered the tomato sandwich which had an extremely appetizing description, boasting about sun-dried tomatoes and some other fixings. i was absolutely, devastating unimpressed with the result. the bread was thick, and although the inside was quite soft and squishy, the outside was hard to chew. and because of it's massive proportions, it sorta towered over the meager components- literally 4 small slices of tomato, one leaf of lettuce, and cream cheese (with tiny chunks of sundried tomato hidden within) sparsely covering the middle of the sandwich. majority of the experience consisted of me chewing dry bread. seriously. 

maybe i'm spoiled because my wife makes such amazing veggie sandwiches, but this is actually the worst restaurant experience i've had in as long as i can remember. i can think of 2000 better places i would have liked to spend my $9. and that's just off the top of my head.

The idea of eating differently from how I was raised simply never really occurred to me until I got to university. Everyone and their dog was a vegetarian or had gone iron-deficient by dabbling in it at one point in their life. It all started to make a bit more sense to me after I dined at Cafe Santropol. I will never forget their decadent and thick homemade rye bread and their triple-decker sandwiches with layers of nut-and-seed filled cream cheeses. Exotic fruits decorated the plates, and there was always more than I could eat. I tried a few things, but my favourite was the tuna, tomato and cream cheese sandwich. The combo was mouth-watering, and for years afterwards I'd try to recreate it at home. On every trip back to Montreal I've stopped in here to introduce their culinary creations to a friend and get another taste. They have a gorgeous, lush patio out back, fenced in and private.

They stop serving brunch at 11:30 so we needed up ordering sandwiches Tuna for me and Chicken Salad for KP. The portions are HUGE and the sandwich itself was ok. I was more a fan of the bread it was very good. I also tried a cassis soda which was try refreshing. Sandwiches are usually not my go to hangover food but it helped and this places was dangerously close to our apt. After tax and tip it came out to be about 13 each.

This café only has $10 and up cream cheese sandwiches and even charge you an extra 80 cents for tomatos. The sandwiches mostly consist of bread.

The service is unfriendly and spotty. I was assigned a table only to be roughly told  I wasn't supposed to be there and reassigned somewhere else. There's an annoying patronizing text on the first page of the menu telling you how much you should tip and that they don't like it when you don't pay cash. 

after ordering a coffee my bill was $4,50, they didn't want to let me pay with debit because of their $5 minimum. Another time the cream cheese and chicken sandwich did not contain any chicken, I sent it back and they just stuffed it with pieces of chicken, the whole thing was grotesque.

All this aside, the staff is either completely rude, or simply cannot be bothered. After arriving, it took 20 minutes to notice me, even though I was standing at the counter. Their online menu is NOT updated, so when I asked for a smoked salmon sandwich, the response (no joke) was, ""we don't carry salmon and fish items, because of the nuclear disaster meltdown in Japan"". So wait, salmon only comes from Japan? I thought Canada had salmon too, no? The other patrons seemed puzzled by the response, but since they'd been waiting for a while, took their seats, when offered (hope they had a better time). Another 10 minutes elapsed before the gentleman decided to take my order. Of course, after this 30 minute investment, it was another 30 minutes for my takeout order to be ready.

It came with a side salad (delicious and fresh greens). Typically, sandwiches come with a poor or mediocre quality salad but not this one! The bread on the sandwich was their signature I believe. Very tasty! The meal also came with a small soup of the day. I got the fish chowder. It was tasty but lacked fish....it was mostly potatoes and veggies. It did have a lot of flavor so I enjoyed it. The food came out sooner than expected and I never felt rushed. Will come here again next time I'm in Montreal!","4 star rating"

The atmosphere at Santropol is laid-back without trying too hard, and the interior has its own homey charm, so that it's worth visiting even when the huge and lush rear patio is closed during the winter.

I'm not a big fan of vegetarian dishes, but I never had a sandwich from Santropol that wasn't totally satisfying.

They have the chillest atmosphere of near any place in Montreal - their insane backyard is sublime, and it's cozy on the inside as well. For a vegetarian, Santropol is one of the best bets you can make. The menu is almost completely devoted to the art of the sandwich.

okay so first off the service was kinda bad. we waited for a while for someone to come over and greet us, and even longer for him to come back and take our orders. apparently they all split tips and worked together, so you can ask anyone to help you. but the food was a huge disappointment. I got a soup and half sandwich and the soup was amazing. the sandwich... okay. first they told me I had to get it with cream cheese, and if I didn't all the other toppings would just fall out. so fine, cream cheese. I ordered it with chicken, which i thought meant chicken deli meat. wrong, chicken means CHICKEN SALAD, which I don't eat. I told this to another server (because my waiter never came over to check on us) and she just brought me another plate to take the chicken salad off the sandwich. but it was covered in mayo (which is the reason I don't eat chicken salad) so it was kinda pointless, plus I wanted a real sandwich not a veggie one. so I just didn't eat my sandwich at all. we waited forever for our check, but finally we stopped someone and they then explained they all work together and we pay at the register. 

overall, it was horrible service, and a  horrible sandwich (my boyfriends, which he did eat, he was unhappy with as well). maybe it would be better if the menu was clearer and they were up front about how they served, but I'd still think they should have checked on us or at least offered another sandwich or something, rather than a plate to take the chicken salad that I didn't know would be there based on the ""add chicken"" option on the menu.

the service was absolutely terrible- probably one of the worst group of wait staff i have ever experienced in my life. they were unforgivably slow and didn't pay much attention. maybe it's cause they knew we were from toronto. but judging from the reviews it seems to be a general consensus that the service at this place sucks. 

the food, however, was delicious albeit slightly overpriced because they charge you for every ingredient you put in your sandwich. i enjoyed a cheese sandwich with lettuce, sliced tomatoes and mayonnaise. everything was fresh and the portion was well sized but i found it was still a little pricey for what it was. my girlfriend got her sandwich split with a soup which was a cool option and she was very happy with both. our other friends were very pleased with the food too. makes me wanna give three stars instead of two, because the meals were absolutely delicious, but we were all really put off by the terrible service.

Finally sitting down, the menu looked promising, So we decided to give a little of everything a try. We tried the soup of the day (a bean and corn soup), we tried their cream cheese sandwiches selections, which sounded pretty good, since some had pesto and some had sun-dried tomato inside. and then we both tried a drink, a cappuccino and a cold chai drink. When our food arrived, here's my description. the sandwiches are huge! But, if you're expecting to taste everything in the sandwich, then go somewhere else. All we tasted was regular salty cream cheese, there was so much cream cheese inside the sandwich, that's all you could taste, no pesto, no sun-dried tomato, no ham nor beef. The soup was bland and the drinks tasted like watered down syrup. Will not be going again, my spouse and I walked for 3 hours after that to try to digest the cream cheese.

The ramen itself was quite bland. I guess maybe if I had zero expectations for that dishes, I might have been alright with the final results.

I'll admit that I came here for ramen and accidentally ordered not-ramen. What's more, I didn't immediately realize that the Udon noodles I ordered actually came as soba noodles ... I'll have to update my review once I've tried the ramen properly, but in the meantime, I'll comment on the noodles anyway! NB that the ramen is not listed in their menu but rather on signs on the wall and chopstick tins; the Japanese soup on the menu is *not* ramen.

Vegetarian options here are fairly good; the ramen broth is vegan, and while the other soup broths are omnivore-only, they'll switch out meat for tofu in any of the other dishes. My partner got vegetarian ramen which came with copious amounts of noodles plus mushrooms, corn, green onion, and a tasty egg that had been marinated in a slightly sweet sauce. The broth was a coconut-tahini broth that was rich like you'd expect from ramen, but had a Thai vibe. I ended up eating a lot of his noodles and they were tasty!

My Japanese noodle soup came with a bunch of veggies including mushrooms, broccoli, and carrots, in a shiitake mushroom broth with bonito flakes. I liked the broth but there was something a bit off about it ... possibly the bonito (which I don't especially like), or the fact that it wasn't the ramen broth I was initially expecting. Nevertheless, a decent value at $12 including tax/tip.

We also had vegetarian spring rolls which were pretty good, and dessert including crème brûlé (great) and lychees in syrup (mediocre).

I'm not usually a big décor woman but I was a big fan of the décor here as it created a nice, cozy Japanese vibe (including the tiny space).

Overall I had a four-star experience but I will mention that some of the cons listed in other reviews are legit: it's not the best or most ramen-y ramen you'll find in town, and it is pretty small and crowded (we went on a Thursday evening).

As for those reviews casting aspersions on the chefs for their Euro ethnic background, this seems more to do with hipster anxieties about how ""authentic"" something is being indicative of, or more important than, its quality. (Presumably they'd find the food better if it was cooked by people with authentic Asian DNA.) An interesting, and in this context ironic, factoid: the restaurant's namesake is a 1985 Japanese comedy film about a(n ethnically Japanese) woman, Tampopo, who owns a struggling ramen restaurant and must learn how to make good ramen noodles.","4 star rating"

When you walk in, you see right away that it's a cozy restaurant. There's places to sit at the bar or small tables where you sit on cushions which really gives it a more traditional Japanese style to it. 

To be honest, I had just come back from Japan so seeing the sitting area got me really excited to eat here. When I was reading over the menu, I saw that there was a great variety of popular dishes all over Asia which is always great to have variety. 

In my experience, restaurants that offer too many different options tend to not taste as authentic. However, Tampopo is advertised as a fusion restaurant, so it was expected. 

I ordered the pork dumplings to share and they were good except that the sweet and sour sauce was a bit too overwhelming. I was really excited for the curry udon I ordered because that is one of my favourite Japanese dishes. When I read the menu, I saw that it came with chicken which really surprised me because usually curry udon is not eaten with any meat or at most beef. So I told that to the waitress and she said that the dish goes well with pork if I wanted to change it, which I thought was very nice of her. 

When I got my dish, I was stunned to see so many vegetables and very little noodles. Typically, curry udon is a thick curry broth with udon noodles, green onions and sometimes seaweed, mushrooms or fish cakes and comes with a hard boiled egg. The curry udon I received was filled with Chinese mushrooms which have a very strong taste, broccoli, carrots, celery and many more. Every spoonful only had vegetables and practically no noodles. What disappointed me was that the broth was not thick at all and barely tasted like curry but more like mushrooms. Halfway through the dish, I had to stop eating because I couldn't stand the taste anymore. 

I understand they they are trying to put a North American twist to Asian meals but this was way too different and it didn't work. The noodles weren't homemade either and I could tell! I may be biased because I just came back from Japan, but they removed too many traditional elements in the meal that I couldn't enjoy it. 

Overall, I might have to give this place another chance but it was quite disappointing. Don't go if you are craving authentic and traditional Asian food.","2 star rating"

We decided to go in for a dinner tonight and were not disappointed! 

The vibe is great - walk in and seat yourself, either at the counter overlooking the tidy kitchen, or at one of the traditional-style settings where you remove your shoes and sit on mats at low tables. It reminded me a lot of my experiences of dining in Bali. Our server was extremely attentive and on the ball, and quite friendly without being obtrusive. 

We chose to sit at the kitchen counter, which was actually really fun. We watched the kitchen staff prepare our meals with a little bit of showmanship, craftfully flinging vegetables into the two large woks. Everyone in the kitchen seemed to really like each other, too. 

The wait time for our main dishes was really reasonable and the serving sizes were EXCELLENT value for the cost. I also asked about whether or not they use MSG in the food, and to my delight, they do not. Our food was served steaming hot and was very good. I ordered the Tampopo noodles, which come with shrimp and a black bean sauce, and there were tons of shrimp in my bowl, which was great! I'm used to restaurants skimping on the shrimp, but not these guys. 

I left with a very full belly and a good feeling about coming back again. They do delivery in the cute takeout boxes, too, so maybe next time I'll order in just for kicks.","4 star rating"

I will start by saying that my boyfriend and I really wanted to like this place - It's so cute, and we love pad thai. How could anything go wrong? 

We went to Tampopo on a Monday evening, and it was as crowded as a Friday. This seemed like a good sign to us. The waitress was really friendly, and she apologized profusely for the fact that their beer tap was broken, which meant they only had bottled Tsing Tao. This turned out to be the best thing about the meal. We ordered appetizers which never came. When we were finally presented with our main dishes 30 minutes after ordering, I asked if the appetizers would be coming after the main course. The waitress seemed shocked and brought us our ticket to show that our appetizers had been ""checked off."" I get that this wasn't her mistake, but where did the appetizers go?

I ordered the vegan Ramen, which was decent, but it . . . wasn't really Ramen? More like straight up noodles in a coconut broth. My boyfriend ordered the pad thai, which was a bit strange. It looked kind of green. He says it tasted ""like someone tried to make pad thai out of lipton chicken soup."" People kept pouring in. The staff kept telling them they could squeeze them in even though they were clearly understaffed. I was so confused. Boyfriend wound up taking his beef dumplings to go, which he says taste as if you drenched chef Boyardee ravioli in peanut sauce (i.e., weird). I decided to forgo my appetizer because I just didn't have any confidence that it would be very good at that point, and we really wanted to leave this inexplicably crowded place.

I agree with some of the other yelpers who have pointed out some obvious red flags, like why would you trust a bunch of white people to make Asian food? And too many items on the menu is a serious red flag. It's a shame, because the environment and location are really great.","2 star rating"

Please note that if you're coming for legit Asian food, you will leave very unsatisfied. I was horrified to see that the laksa came on a plate with thick sauce smothered all over it. 

Laksa is usually a bowl of hearty, spicy soup noodles with the most aromatic coconut flavours. So imagine my surprise when it came out on a plate? 

The ramen itself was quite bland. I guess maybe if I had zero expectations for that dishes, I might have been alright with the final results. But if I'm ordering something on the menu named ""laksa"" or even ""pad Thai"", I will have prior expectations for what I'm going to eat.

I'll admit that I came here for ramen and accidentally ordered not-ramen. What's more, I didn't immediately realize that the Udon noodles I ordered actually came as soba noodles ... I'll have to update my review once I've tried the ramen properly, but in the meantime, I'll comment on the noodles anyway! NB that the ramen is not listed in their menu but rather on signs on the wall and chopstick tins; the Japanese soup on the menu is *not* ramen.

Vegetarian options here are fairly good; the ramen broth is vegan, and while the other soup broths are omnivore-only, they'll switch out meat for tofu in any of the other dishes. My partner got vegetarian ramen which came with copious amounts of noodles plus mushrooms, corn, green onion, and a tasty egg that had been marinated in a slightly sweet sauce. The broth was a coconut-tahini broth that was rich like you'd expect from ramen, but had a Thai vibe. I ended up eating a lot of his noodles and they were tasty!

My Japanese noodle soup came with a bunch of veggies including mushrooms, broccoli, and carrots, in a shiitake mushroom broth with bonito flakes. I liked the broth but there was something a bit off about it ... possibly the bonito (which I don't especially like), or the fact that it wasn't the ramen broth I was initially expecting. Nevertheless, a decent value at $12 including tax/tip.

We also had vegetarian spring rolls which were pretty good, and dessert including crème brûlé (great) and lychees in syrup (mediocre).

I'm not usually a big décor woman but I was a big fan of the décor here as it created a nice, cozy Japanese vibe (including the tiny space).

Overall I had a four-star experience but I will mention that some of the cons listed in other reviews are legit: it's not the best or most ramen-y ramen you'll find in town, and it is pretty small and crowded (we went on a Thursday evening).

As for those reviews casting aspersions on the chefs for their Euro ethnic background, this seems more to do with hipster anxieties about how ""authentic"" something is being indicative of, or more important than, its quality. (Presumably they'd find the food better if it was cooked by people with authentic Asian DNA.) An interesting, and in this context ironic, factoid: the restaurant's namesake is a 1985 Japanese comedy film about a(n ethnically Japanese) woman, Tampopo, who owns a struggling ramen restaurant and must learn how to make good ramen noodles.","4 star rating"

It took 1 hour and 40 minutes from the time I called for the food to be delivered (I live 10-15 away by car).

My girlfriend ordered a meal soup which was average (say 6 out of 10), we shared dumplings in 'peanut sauce'. The sauce was awful and not so peanutty, the dumplings tasted as if they were had come out of a can. I ordered the Pad Thai. Hands down not only the worst Pad Thai I've ever tasted, but one of the worst meals I've had in years in any restaurant. The noodles were white, mushy and overcooked, the chicken tasted as if the 'chef' had boiled a frozen chicken breast then chopped it into cubes. Then I imagine the noodles and boiled chicken cubes were thrown into the box together, with no hint of seasoning, spice or peanuts. There were tiny pieces of white bland tofu thrown in as well, as if only to enhance the general lack of anything resembling flavour. I found a tiny piece of lime somewhere in the middle of my tower of noodles - my best guess is that this was a failed attempt to add any sort of taste at all to the dish...hoping that through some sort of magical osmosis the rest of the ingredients would soak up every last drop of the lime's essence.

I wish I had eaten this at the restaurant, in which case I could have returned the food and left without paying. Instead I was at home, still hungry (threw out most of my food), down $30.

After several days of endless poutine and gluttonous foie gras meals, I was on the search for something clean and healthy.  Both pho and ramen, popular on the West Coast when weather dips cooler don't appear to be much on the radar in Montreal. 

Fortunately, Pho Mont-Royal fit the bill and, although my expectations were tempered, hit the spot. 

The restaurant space is long and narrow with plentiful table seating and natural lighting.  Vietnamese music played quietly in the background and there's a Vietnamese mural, the decor is clean and bright.  The menu focuses largely on noodle soups, dry vermicelli dishes, and rice dishes. Our order:

BBQ Quail - $5.50. I had seen Quail on a few Gre ch restaurant menus in the area and decided to try one here.  It was nicely crispy and seasoned well with a side of fish sauce. Simple but tasty. 

Pho Dac Biet and Pho Tai Nam Sac - $10. Both dishes were large and generous for the price and also available with rare beef on the side (always a baseline good sign).  The broth was appropriately hot and cooked the rare beef nicely with a flavor that while not particularly beefy or full of depth hit my pho craving.  Noodles were ok, likely dry packaged noodles, and the tendons were quite tough, not cooked long enough in the broth. The meat slices however were quite good quality especially in the Pho Dac Biet.  Although the pho Tai Nam Sac was priced the same, I found the well cooked steak to be tougher and thicker cut.  Def go for the Pho Dac Biet. 

Overall, we had a good meal here.  Coming from California, I was looking for an alternative to the rich and deep fried food of Montreal and Pho Mont-Royal delivered. 

Pho Mont Royal accepts credit cards but not Amex.","3 star rating"

I've ordered from this place a handful of times and I think I can make an informed review by now. 

Delivery has always been fast and friendly. And the food is always hot and fresh. 

I order for the pho (rare beef) mostly, as I miss it from back home. It is a decent enough broth, a little anise heavy, but a clear beefy broth that's been prepared well. The noodles are always the right texture, and they always give you a good amount of sprouts/basil. 

Their fried goods are always tasty and not greasy. 

The portions of their take-out meals (grilled chicken, lemongrass chicken)  are on the small side(judging by photos it seems you get more if you eat in) and am a little disappointed that they use styrofoam for their delivery containers.

All said and done it hits the spot enough and the quality and convenience outweighs the negatives.","3 star rating"

Ok, so first let's just start with the take-out menu I read: there's no description for spring rolls, imperial rolls, etc. So thinking spring rolls were veggie, I ordered them. Thank god I noticed there were prawns inside before I took a bite or my ghost would be writing this review. Now onto the phō: the broth was terribly bland. By the time I got done with it, it was 97% soy sauce and siracha. Also there was no mint or sprouts???? And the chicken was grilled then put in with the veg, instead of cooked in the broth, so I found that very odd. I'm still new to Montreal, so I'm not sure if this place just wasn't great or of this is normal Montreal practice--you know, to have lacklustre Asian food. God, I miss Vancouver.","2 star rating"

I went with their Pad Thai ($15) which came with a soup and roll. The soup was good, the roll was thin & crunchy... just right. The Pad Thai was good but I'll admit I've had far better.

NooBox is very interesting in the sense that it let you choose and make your own meal.

Then you get to choose your sauce; sweet and sour, spicy curry, teriyaki, etc. And finally, you get a protein: beef, shrimp, chicken, or tofu. 
The concept is very interesting; the fun thing about it is that you can make your meal completely vegan. They also tell you which sauce is vegan, which sauce is gluten free. 
It's like a make it yourself Thai express as the prices are very similar and they also serve you good portions.

Unfortunately our experience was the former. 
The aesthetically pleasing @gonbuiresto is sadly just that. All looks and very little quality. Very small portions for the price, very average, unsatisfactory, deceptive Chinese fusion at best which we would like to talk more about but the quantity was just too little... to the point where we actually went next door to @escondite_mtl for a quesadilla afterwards. Furthermore we had an incredibly long wait despite a semi-empty house.

This restaurant offers nothing but the absolute most ""mid"" experience of my life. Maybe it's better known for its drinks. Hearsay said otherwise though.

Frankly, I'm a bit sad. It would be one thing if the food was simply plain --I know plain, I don't mind plain, I wouldn't be writing this if plain were the only issue. But this place reeks of mediocrity, its claw forcibly turns my head to stare at routine and suffocating 9-to-5s, at dread and at that muddled midlife stir that so often becomes crisis.

It's still new (opened in Dec 2021), the service was excellent and the waitress that we had was courteous and informative about the menu. Speaking of which, the menu was small, only a dozen items but I expect them to add more choice as time goes on when their business grows.

The food was good : the Bang Bang chicken and its sauce were excellent as well as the salted egg carbonara. If you've never had jellyfish, you should try their jellyfish and chicken dish (presented like a cold salad). Nonetheless, we thought that some dishes could be better : the fried calamari were soggy and lacking, the sauce in the longevity noodles were overly sweet and the Peking duck a bit on the pricey side (35$+tx) for 10 slices of duck. The cocktails, although pretty and Instagram-worthy, were very expensive (16$+tx). Instead, we chose their Hong Kong Milk tea and Lemon tea to quench our thirst and we were satisfied with our choices.

Overall, it is a nice restaurant for outings and casual high end fusion Cantonese food. I wouldn't mind coming back here with family, with a date or with friends to spend a fun foodie evening.","4 star rating"

Very cute decor and pretty bar area

Friendly and fast service 
It's nice they ask you your name and you pay the bill threw a QR code which avoids them printing a paper bill.

We got the bang bang chicken, the shrimp dumplings and also the carbonara noodles.
We couldn't decide on which one of those were are favourite because they were all so delicious. Perfect portion to share and also pricing very reasonable and not expensive.

Food is served in this cute Chinese plates which I find so nice. I think they thought about every detail when opening this restaurant

Will definitely come back to try other stuff from the menu.

They also had some signature drinks, all there drinks were doubles and only around 15$.
We got the Pinky Swear which was a very refreshing drink. Definitely a must if you go there.

Seems like this place is always full house, the only down side is that the tables are too close to each other and you can hear the other person's conversation. Music was also pretty loud.

The menu changes often and I hope it continues to rotate throughout the year for some seasonal items and some evergreen items. 

I really like how I can pay my bill at the table without the waiter. Helps with the wait time. 

I think the only thing I would try to change is the amount of dips there is. Most our dishes came with two bowls/plates. One for dipping or pouring into another dish. If the waiter could do the pouring that would bring in some cool entertainment value that isn't solely focused on the customer doing a thing other than eating. It isn't bad (very yummy) but just a pattern we had noticed coming there the second time.

Unfortunately our experience was the former. 
The aesthetically pleasing @gonbuiresto is sadly just that. All looks and very little quality. Very small portions for the price, very average, unsatisfactory, deceptive Chinese fusion at best which we would like to talk more about but the quantity was just too little... to the point where we actually went next door to @escondite_mtl for a quesadilla afterwards. Furthermore we had an incredibly long wait despite a semi-empty house.

Cons
1. Utensils did not look clean

Portions were plentiful...ordered a small but size did not fail. Beef was tender and had right amount of mest and fat ratio.

Best part...the broth! On a cold snowy day...this is exactly what the doctor ordered. So flavorful and tasty..not heavy on msg..( didnt feel thirsty after). 

Lots of onions and and cilantro....perfectly ending to a day of sightseeing in the cold.

The front staff included a middle aged woman (looks like the mother) and a younger pretty girl (probably the daughter). The woman was not rude, but in no way friendly when she took our order. The girl was soft spoken and nice and had a friendly face. We ordered and waited for while. Finally our entrees came out, all 5 except 1. After 5 minutes, we reminded them, and they said it takes a bit longer for his meal, so another 5 minutes. OK, so we waited.. While waiting, here's my take on the other aspect of the restaurant: 

Ambiance: Neon signs, fake flowers, old dirty chairs and tables - basically, a typical run down Vietnamese restaurant. There were many tables here, and the restaurant can hold a lot of customers. When we came in for dinner, there were about 5 or 6 other groups in there.
Cleanliness: dirty and smelly
Staff: owner was not so friendly, the younger girl is nice
Price: seems lower cost than other places, but i'd rather pay $2 more for a better meal.

ALL of our entrees finally showed up. Thinking of the food we had makes me kind of mad right now.. but here is our food:

Com ga gung xa: this was good. chicken was soft. this was the only decent plate from our group.

Pho tai: lots of liquid and not much to actually eat. the broth itself was not good either. it's just weird, not the normal pho taste. My dad always orders Pho Tai everywhere he goes, and he couldn't even eat this. 

Pho ThaiLand style: this sucks. Basically the broth taste of bo kho. it has carrots and tomatoes, a bunch of vegies that you normally don't find in pho, and then they add a little spice in it, and call it pho ThaiLan. 

Bun Thit (heo) Nuong Cha Gio: Normal. Nothing special. Nothing good. Didn't finish my meal. they didn't' have peanuts, the shred lettuce they put in there was minimal. I don't remember having bean sprouts in it, which it should. There were no mints.

Bun Thit Bo Cha Gio: This was the entree that they had pictured on the table. 2 people saw this picture and ordered it. This was better than their disgusting soup dishes, but the worst of the dry dishes. The beef was dry, the cucumber was soggy and almost gone bad, tomatoes are overly ripe, basically.. I feel VERY bad for everyone at the table, especially my parents, who had Pho Tai and this Bun Thit Bo Cha Gio. 

Final Verdict: I wouldn't come back if you paid me.","1 star rating"

Pho2000 is one of those places.  It was open! (+1), there were people eating in it (+1), the portions looked good (+1), the prices seemed reasonable.  So the restaurant itself is pretty dingy, and the staff is your classic Asian mom+pop who are a little grumpy, but i like that.  we tried the Imperial rolls, and i had the Spicy Thai Beef Pho.  The food didn't come out in 30 seconds, so they must have been prepping something, and when it did come out, it was super tasty, full of nice veggies and slices of beef which cooked some more in the broth, and was especially fiery with some added hot sauce.

Check it out once, at least.","3 star rating"

This my go to place when I am craving two things: spring rolls (not the fried type) and soup. 

Every time I go I order the #2 Spring rolls with shrimp and the #5 spicy Thai soup. You get two freshly made spring rolls, along with an amazing peanut sauce. I usually add some spicy sauce to it and it makes for a perfect kick. I've been to many places around Montreal and I haven't found a place that makes better spring rolls.

For the soup again lots of fresh vegetables, noodles and a very tasty broth. I've had many different soups here, and they are all good. Unfortunately I have not tried much of the other food, mostly because the soup and springs rolls are that good.

If you are in the area and you are hungry, this is definitely the place. Don't worry about the looks of the place, you will get food that will make you want to come back again, and again!","5 star rating"

The broth has those layers of richness and subtle flavors that make a great soup base. I have been several times and have tried all the various varieties. The satay beef (spicy) is my favorite. Imperial rolls were so-so. I haven't tried any of the other dishes, and really, why bother?

For the life of me, I don't know why they couldn't put a tiny bit more effort into cleaning and updating the interior. But, it doesn't bother me that the place feels like you are actually IN Vietnam. I think that is charming. Prices aren't bad. An extra large pho is about $10, and you will be stuffed if you can manage to finish all the broth. 

Montreal is cold in the winter time, and this pho hits the spot, leaving you warm and satiated for the rest of the day.","4 star rating"

It is a great restaurant for vegetarians. Their general Tao tofu are to die for (a vegetarian take on general tao chicken). People can get very wary about tofu but trust me, as a meat eater, it was delicious. They also have a Asian fusion poutine that I haven't tried yet.

I go to Sesame regularly for their vegetarian General Tao tofu. It is the ONLY place I have EVER found that does it right! It is *not* the mushy watery sponges of soft tofu most of the restaurants serve, it is prepared in the same way as the General Tao chicken is with a crispy batter and sweet and sour style sauce only with lovely firm cubes of Tofu in the center.

Now, I promised that this was a review not only of the food but of the amazing customer service I have received there. On occasion there has been a mixup with the food ordered, it can happen to the best of us. On this particular occasion unfortunately a pice of chicken found its way into to order I had just picked up to take home for dinner. When I called the restaurant from my house, despite remembering my order and being perplexed as to how that could have happened, they took me at my word, and offered to make me a fresh order AND deliver it to my house personally (even though delivery is not a service they offer). It got here about 15min after I called, still too hot to eat! It was kind of amazing.","5 star rating"

When I discovered that this restaurant had a sweet and sour battered tofu I was eager to give it a try. The General Tao tofu, and the a l'orange version, are absolutely fantastic; they satisfy the craving completely and are incredibly morish.

Back down to Earth for a moment, I've been there five times now and the service and food constancy are extremely INconsistent. The sides seem to change depending on who cooks the food, which feels lazy rather than necessary.

Because we were a big group some people are vegetarian some are celiac so it's the place to go if you want to please everyone. I was nicely surprise, the service was amazing the food was well seasoned even if all the dishes are classic well know Asian/occidental dishes.

I really wanted to like it because the ambiance is so cool and it's not too far from my house.

The first time I ordered an assortment of foods, all bland and dry. 

The next time I ordered one of their meal soups and it was terrible.  I think you would get better soup if you bought one of those dry noodle bowls at the grocery store... you know the ones you add water to. It was extremely salty and tasteless.","1 star rating"

It tasted decent, at best.

My wonton soup was a bit spicy and packed with vegetables, which I did enjoy. However, the lack of dumplings disappointed me. I mean, whoever heard of a wonton soup with only two dumplings in it?

I appreciated the fact that there were actual chunks of really crispy chicken in my General Tao, but it was completely bland and the sauce was tasteless. If a restaurant advertises a meal as 'spicy', the chef should ensure that it actually is. 

However, the blackberry tea was just magnificent. Too bad I didn't think of bringing some back home.

The space is small, but it isn't too difficult to find a table, despite the high number of reservations. Wait times were quick, and the waitress was polite and professional, refilled my glass of water without me having to ask her (I'm kind of picky about that), etc.

Unfortunately, I wouldn't return to eat there if only for the fact that I've had much better Szechuan elsewhere.","2 star rating"

The restaurant looks like its family run with all hands on deck. That's how you know the food will taste good. While it's tucked away in a neighbourhood, it was quite busy with people constantly coming in and out of the place getting food. The inside has a fake tree decoration which looked neat. It looked like they had put some thought into decorating it unlike some other typical mom and pop Asian restaurants. 

As for food, I ordered Pad Thai with beef while my boyfriend got the orange beef with rice. They also have some sushi combos but we didn't feel like trying sushi that day. The portions are pretty big - especially my Pad Thai. There were also a lot of beef pieces hidden away on the bottom so it felt like it was really worth the price. The orange beef was also good.

Answer: 40% chance, therefore please work on your staffing, and please deliver superbe customer service. 

If you cannot afford a bus-boy, customers can do it for you ! Just make available empty plastic containers on the counter so that we can put dirty dishes there, to alleviate the workload of your staff. 

Food is actually above-average. 

Thank you !","3 star rating"

I am an ex chef and I'm notoriously hard to please.  But from the receipt of the order I smells coming from the bag where the first wonderfull sign that this word be on of the best meals we have enjoyed during the COVID19 Quarantine.  I had the Classic Burger at $18 it lived up to this. It was crunchie and beyond delicous,and sufficiently messy.  My nephew had the Vegan taco. And he truly enjoyed both the texture and the taste. Both meals served with wedge fries that were delicous in their selves.  We were blown away by the taste and the value of this meal. The Almond shakes sceeled a perfect meal.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.","5 star rating"

Got the burrito bowl and a bacon-cheeseburger from UberEats tonight and loved them both. The portions were generous without being ridiculous, the burger came with yummy potato wedges and a salad, and the bowl was filled with goodness. The food came fast and was exactly as we'd ordered it (certain burger toppings ""held"" as requested). 
I'm so glad that such a delicious vegan food option exists in the area. It's not cheap, but fresh, good food that's made with care is worth the price. Oh also, we had the chocolate mousse for dessert, and my life is forever changed. Don't miss out. You've had a long year, you deserve it. 
This is the place you take your relatives who don't believe vegan food can be filling, nutritious and still taste amazing. I can't wait until eat-in is an option, but we'll definitely be back for more either way.","5 star rating"

First of all , I am definitely not a vegan lol or even close to it. However my friend suggested that we go there and nonetheless I like trying new places! This place ended up being so not what I expected when you think ""vegan"" ,the vibe & decor is upscale and chill ,the staff? Every restaurant should have staff who are as great as these employees! Very clean place. We ordered two items from their apps and had drinks! 
We had the messy fries & cauliflower fever or forever ( dont remember) the messy fries were really yummy & the cauliflower was good too I just wish the dressing they put on top wasn't so thick and textured..and make it more smooth? I feel like that would amplify the dish even better.  The drinks were Ahhhh-mazing. They had a really nice choices for wine and a full cocktail bar! It was delicious. I heard they also do brunch! So I'll definitely be going back to try it out! However if you're a vegan THIS place will probably your favorite place to eat at!","4 star rating"

So the dinner deserves between 4-5 stars because of the abundance of fresh vegetables and delicious sauces. There isn't a heavy reliance on tofu and just the right amount of grains (compared to other vegan spots) for a delicious and healthy dinner. But, oh man. The breakfast needs a lot of work. It's mostly grains and tofu with very very very little fruits or vegetables. Making Chez Cora look like a healthy alternative (and it really shouldn't be). So the brunch deserves a 2-3 stars only; and it hurts to say so. If they up the fruit and veggies content of their brunch this Monkland Village joint will easily become my #1 vegan spot!

We sat on their terrace. The inside was nice and bright. The wait staff was very attentive and ready to help us choose. The recommendations were excellent. I had the Green Bowl which was full of yummy vegetables on a bed of quinoa and a generous portion of smashed avocado. It's nice that they serve the dressing on the side (I used all of it). My friend had the spicy bowl and also enjoyed it. We started with their messy fries and these are not fries as you might expect, they are potato wedges topped with a mess of ingredients.

I had the ""benny benny"" - two vegan ""eggs benedict"" with a small side salad and a few potato wedges. My friend had the breakfast bowl - tofu scramble, chili, and veggies on brown rice.

The pros: 
The eggs benedict were flavourful and unique. I haven't had anything else similar before. They also have a pretty extensive menu with lots of gluten-free options (including things like waffles and pancakes that are normally hard to find gf). The restaurant is big and has a nice outdoor seating area. The staff were friendly and the food was quick.

The cons: 
While the ""eggs"" were tasty, they're really just a ton of tofu covered in sauce on a bun. I could only eat one, even though I wasn't full, because I felt like I was consuming a whole block of blended tofu. More variety would have been nice, like a larger side salad or some fruit. My friend's breakfast bowl was not good. About half the bowl was (dry) rice and the tofu scramble was tasteless. 
What really ruined the meal though was that the coffee (which is not included in the brunch) was absolutely awful. It was just filter coffee, sure, but if you're a restaurant that serves breakfast, the coffee should at least be drinkable and not watery. I was on the fence about this place until then, but that kind of sealed the deal. I can't feel good about paying $25 for brunch and then having to go get coffee from a cafe afterward. 
Finally, the inside of the restaurant is super loud. I would suggest eating outside if at all possible. 

Tl;dr: Food tastes good but they tend to fill up plates with cheap ingredients like tofu, bread, and rice, while still charging a lot. The coffee is notably horrible. Staff are friendly.","2 star rating"

It's not a fancy place but a good restaurant for casual suppers between friends and family. It's very affordable but could be seen a little more expensive than other Vietnamese restaurant.

I often order their grilled chicken pho. One of the reasons why I love their grilled chicken pho is because they add so much veggies to the bowl! I enjoy my food much more when it is bright, colourful and gives me all the nutrients that I need. I do agree with the other reviewers that their bowl of pho don't come with enough meat.

For their appetizer, I had their fish sauce chicken wings... and oh my... it was delicious. A little bit crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Their wings were packed with flavours!

Lastly, their avocado smoothie with bubbles... it's silky and smooth. Best avocado smoothie in the entire Montreal...

We waited less than 10 minutes to be seated and the service was quite fast. 
There are not that many vietnameses restaurants southshore, so I could say I will go back and eat here for the food. Staff was vietnamese, which was another good sign.

We tried the Hu-Tieu, a rice meal and their Bo-ba-mon (3 beef plate that you roll with rice papers).
We were all hungry so the meals were tasty and satisfying.
I cannot say we were as please with the drinks. We asked for two fresh fruit shakes, one with jackfruit and one with durian with less sugar. They messed up the order giving us two shakes that almost tasted the same and were as sweet as hell.

As the the vietnamese café-sua-da which usually has condensed milk to make it a bit sweeter, they forgot about it.. 

The ""nuoc mia"" was fresh!
Did not try their pho yet, maybe next time!","4 star rating"

We had two soups, one classic and one crab w/ tomato. They were both very good. The Pho probably wasn't the best one I tried yet should definitely go to the top rankings. The crab soup with a pork bone was new to me. The soup was too clear, not thick as I had before in other restaurant. 

The second time I was here I tried the small pancakes  #45, with coconut cream and shrimps. The set was presented on a woven bamboo plate and with 5 kinds of fresh herbs. The pancakes were fired and crispy, very delicious.","4 star rating"

The Pho MC just expanded with a Banh Mi MC counter. I tried the classic cold cut and the grilled beef banh mi! Good bread and nice slices of meet, the brisket is the sandwich is very good. The beef banh mi, the sauce is savory just like my favorite place in montreal. 
If you are done with your grocery and want a quick snack, banh mi is the way to go! 
They have a combo with a mini chicken pho, the broth is good and bright, if you want a full size you can go next door to the pho place. They also served bubbletea and vietnamese ice coffee.

Keep the good guy MC team!

I brought my siblings to try Pho MC on a cold Fall night (we were craving hot, brothy soups). After reading the reviews, I was expecting the same standards as other pho places in Montreal like Pho Bowl in NDG but we were disappointed. 

First of all, every single white soup spoon was dirty. Every single one. Out of around 20 of them on our table alone... yes I checked them all. Unacceptable. 

We picked the least dirty 3 and cleaned them with hot water and tissue. Then the soups arrived. They were lukewarm, not hot. Wth? Why wouldn't the soup be hot? We asked for one to be reheated but by the time it came back, the timing was off and some of us were done eating so we just left everything as is, paid and left. Someone at the table behind us also asked for their soup to be reheated so obviously there was an issue.

Realllyyyyy underwhelmed and won't go back.","2 star rating"

I saw this Pho MC place when I went grocery shopping with my mom. 
There's nothing better than a hot savoury bowl of Pho in this winter snowy weather.

I ordered the small bowl Pho with rare beef and it was delicious. The noodle had a good chewiness to them. The broth had a very good meaty taste to it; you can't get enough of the broth. The mint leaf and bean sprout were fresh. You also have a good amount of beef. The waiters were very nice. You get a nice green tea instead of water; of course you can ask for water if you don't like green tea.

I had the pleasure to go on the lunch hour and saw the employees hand rolling their spring rolls so I can tell you that their spring rolls are daily made.","5 star rating"

I am a pretty regular visitor, usually once a week, after a grocery shopping nearby.

As many pointed out, the taste is great and the service is quick and the price is reasonable. Pho (rice noodle) is a must-go menu, and I liked their Cum-sung (grilled pork with rice) a lot too. If you are new to try the Vietnamese noodle, I dare advise you to start from simple meat, not including any intestines. The meat options are not necessarily to be ""well-done"", ""rare"" might be more soft and will be cooked anyway with the hot broth, especially if you prefer medium or medium rare steak. 

You might not expect kind service, explaining all the menu or recommendation. Usually, its quite busy and packed with people and I experienced once like, the order was missed - so I had to remind the server and wait for a long time. However, this could be possible, as I visited there may be more than 50+ times, as well as usually very busy. 

Strongly recommend, not super strong for the beginner, but still keeping the authentic dish with reasonable price and service.","5 star rating"

I took number 22 to me it was amazing really enjoyed the yellow noodles which is made with flower and not rice . It also had a shrimp cake normal shrimp and pork veggies. Wasn't super busy so service was good the waiter was nice and help full I think I he might be gay. The thing I didn't like was the bathroom the doors and wide open and if you want to pee your in plain vie of everyone who happens to Walk by you can close the door it doest lock . That's the men's bathroom dont know about the women's . 2end thing was I got my food a good 6-8 mins after my father we order at the same time but didn't get our food together.

I usually don't eat Pho but I heard it was a nice place to eat, so I gave it a try. First of all, I had their cháo quay to eat with my pho and it was pretty good. The quality of their broth is almost as good as my mom's broth when she makes pho at home. Even though their food was good, I didn't really feel welcomed. There was literally no communication with the customer and the waiter. When I finished to eat, I proceed to pay and the person who was at the cash register literally didn't even glance at us, she was doing something else while I was trying to communicate with her.

The menu is a lot more eclectic than what's usually offered in Vietnamese restaurant, with a multitude of dishes. The decor was on point, it looked like a modern casual restaurant, and the staff were friendly enough.

I ordered a Hu Tieu Nam Vang, which is a Vietnamesation of a Cambodian dish: Phnom Penh noodles. Cross-over like this happens all the time in South East Asia, due to the geographical situation. Comes with a side broth, and I added a bit of hot Habaneros to spice it up. It was ok but the meat was on the dryer scale of things. 

The iced coffee was ok.

Would return if I don't have to wait in a line, and if I'm around. I won't travel all the way from Montreal for it again tho.","3 star rating"

First of all, the waiters cannot follow the order. The soup is the most uncomfortable food I have ever eaten. I do not believe in their soup and they are tired of eating, like the taste of the flavoring seasoning with many additives. So even after I finished eating I was thirsty and I felt uncomfortable. It wasn't really a soup I had made. Will not go. 
out d'abord, les serveurs ne peuvent pas suivre la commande, la soupe est la nourriture la plus inconfortable que j'ai jamais mangée, je ne crois pas à leur soupe et ils sont fatigués de manger, comme le goût de l'umami avec de nombreux additifs.

Good phõ options to choose from starting under $10. Walking distance from C&T so you know they won't run out of condiments... Ever!

Bubble tea served with underboiled pearls and fried bannanas garnished with frozen fruits is nothing to write home about... Did I mention C&T is next door??

After all, there is a significant Chinese community and we knew two Dim Sum Places. The first one was way overcrowded with 50 groups ahead of us and the other... well, it had closed! There something to be said about planning ahead.

Anyway, being now a bit pressed for time, we ended up here. Nothing really fantastic but the food is good. My son had a Pho which was tasty and the size was quite generous. The same was true for my beef noodle plate. The imperial rolls were passable.

Ambiance is convivial and so was the service. It is a clean and comfortable place and we were happy with experience even though we would not make a detour to come here.","3 star rating"

The replacement noodles weren't as enjoyable but the rest of the dish was great. The hot and sour was spot on and addictive. The sliced cucumber added a nice refreshing contrast. Note, this is a cold style dish.

- Chinese crispy pancake (G6) ($4.99) - this is jianbing, which translates to fried pancake. It's a popular street food - think of it as a Chinese style crêpe. I've never seen this before in Montreal so that was sweet. Every bite was tasty; crispy and eggy but light.

- Handmade noodle (G4) ($9.99) - these were respectable. Had a pretty good bite to the noodles but they still don't beat my favourite from La Maison du Nord.

- BBQ lamb skewer (J1) ($5.99) - tasted pretty authentic to me with the typical Northern Chinese spice rub. However, you only get three skewers and they're on the smaller side.

I had been meaning to come here for weeks, but couldn't find a friend to come with. And then we finally made it.

Soup dumplings are kind of an acquired taste I think. First time I had them, I thought it was nasty, but then the more I ate them the more a learned to like them. 

Honestly, they are kinda fussy to eat. They come in the bamboo tray steaming hot. You have to wait for them to cool a bit before you bite into them otherwise you might scald your tongue. But if you wait too long the soupy liquid inside starts to congeal and you lose that soupy texture that makes them unique.

I usually put them in my spoon and poke a hole in it to let the soup seep out then douse it with black vinegar then eat it in two bites.

At Mei restaurant, the vinegar is already on the table so you put the amount you want. One important thing I'm missing is usually the vinegar has slivers of ginger in it, which brings out a lot of flavor. But here there is no ginger, I didn't bother asking for any.

I am rather disappointed with the soup dumplings here. The filling is not soupy enough for me, and the meat inside is just ok. I feel like there's something missing, but I can't describe it exactly, the wrapping is a bit thick to my liking, and the texture inside is off. When you pick it up with your chopstick it doesn't sag the way it's supposed to... maybe i'm just being snooty but I was looking for satisfaction and didn't find it.

As far as I know there aren't any place in Mtl that make it well. I've had some at Kam Fung in brossard for dim sum and they were not good. 

The crispy chinese crepe was very crispy and tasty though, so at least that was a good find. We also ordered the regular dumplings which were 7-8$ for 15, they were amazing, as good as mai xiang yuan on St-Laurent, and cheaper.

I would definitely come back for regular dumpling and crispy crepe, it's very good and so cheap :)","3 star rating"

But if you wait too long the soupy liquid inside starts to congeal and you lose that soupy texture that makes them unique.

I usually put them in my spoon and poke a hole in it to let the soup seep out then douse it with black vinegar then eat it in two bites.

At Mei restaurant, the vinegar is already on the table so you put the amount you want. One important thing I'm missing is usually the vinegar has slivers of ginger in it, which brings out a lot of flavor. But here there is no ginger, I didn't bother asking for any.

I am rather disappointed with the soup dumplings here. The filling is not soupy enough for me, and the meat inside is just ok. I feel like there's something missing, but I can't describe it exactly, the wrapping is a bit thick to my liking, and the texture inside is off. When you pick it up with your chopstick it doesn't sag the way it's supposed to... maybe i'm just being snooty but I was looking for satisfaction and didn't find it.

As far as I know there aren't any place in Mtl that make it well. I've had some at Kam Fung in brossard for dim sum and they were not good. 

The crispy chinese crepe was very crispy and tasty though, so at least that was a good find. We also ordered the regular dumplings which were 7-8$ for 15, they were amazing, as good as mai xiang yuan on St-Laurent, and cheaper.

I would definitely come back for regular dumpling and crispy crepe, it's very good and so cheap :)","3 star rating"

The place looks sketchy from the outside, but when you get inside... DAYUM.
Traditional Chinese decoration. 
There were so many dishes to try omgogmog. 
I went for a JianBing (must try) compare to the one I had before on Saint-catherine street. This one was pretty decent. 
Then, we tried some kind of ""rolled dumplings. Enjoyable side dishes. Same feeling as dumpling. It was great.
My love for lamb meat made me try the 羊肉串 (Lamb skewered), I'd say it's not the best (I didn't went crazy about it), but it tastes good. 
I also went for the Stewed Lamb noodle. DAYUUUMMMMM When the soup noodle tastes like lamb, i swear it was incredible haha. 
I talked a lot with my friend on that day. There wasn't many customers, so they let us stay. They even offered tea for free.
Good customer service. Kind waitress. Cup always filled with water.
Bad point: Takes a while before food comes, don't go if you are in a rush.
Decoration is great. Traditional chinese.
I will definitely come back to try more of their dishes.

In Chinese culture, dumplings are world in themselves. Having tried the steamed, fried and various dim-sum varieties I have been itching to try out the real soup dumplings of Shanghai for a while now. No, they are not dumplings in a soup, but rather soup inside of dumplings. The mystery is in the preparation, a mixture of meat, veggies and spices along with some fat are placed in the dumpling and closed up. Place the dumpling on hot steam, and the steam renders the fat into a delicious broth inside the dumpling. 

Whatever you do, don't bite into the dumpling straight away or else you're going to risk scalding your mouth. Rather, puncture a small hole and sip out the broth slowly and then eat the dumpling. I think this is the only place in Chinatown2 that makes the real thing. Go check it out and try it, you'll be hooked by the slurpy deliciousness.","4 star rating"

I went to this restaurant several years ago with a chinese friend, and I had a great experience. She ordered food in mandarin, so there was no problem at all in getting what she wanted.

Last month, I got a voucher and decided to go there again. When I called for reservation, my big surprise was that the person spoke little English, so I had to use my ""best"" mandarin to be able to reserve a table.

The day we went, the waitress again spoke little English (I think she's the one I spoke to the day before) and so when it was the time to take the order, we failed to communicate that the dishes are quite big enough for two people to eat, so I ended up ordering two plates of each thing we ordered.... (with no possibility of cancelling)

The food was great though! the dumplings delicious, and the crepe a bit oily, xiao long bao (my significant other's favorite) lacked soup, but they were tasty.
There was also a red bean soup that is great as a dessert in my opinion but in the menu, the picture looked like another kind of soup...

I noticed close to us a small group of westerners like me and an Asian man, again the waitress was having trouble understanding their English, and even addressed the Asian man who told her he only spoke a bit of Cantonese...

So in all I was lucky to be able to speak a functional mandarin (not without glitches) and this way perhaps saved ourselves from a potential ordering of the whole menu... 

In all great restaurant, bring a 哥们儿 along ;)","3 star rating"

The menu using many photos might suggest would be easy to navigate, not. There were several menu items that had no prices?
We started with the special wonton soup (not) and the Seaweed and egg drop soup (reasonable), the portion size was small as were all the plates except the Curry Beef dumplings.

Here's a question why were half of the Curry Beef dumplings sour and the other not? The beef in the dumplings must have been half fat was when bitten into a good spoonful of grease poured out.

The homemade noodle with pork were contained both bean sprouts and shredded cucumber, so there was a puddle under the noodles which tasteless despite the addition of the chilly oil and soy sauce.

Whether or not one is accustomed to these flavours is not so much the point as the lack of flavour. The red bean soup is meant to be dessert = sweet (not) even the rice flour dumplings in the soup had no sugar.

In all the plates there was no use of salt or seasonings. The meal was a major letdown as were the scary dirty bathroom with an overhead fan that made so much noise it shook the fillings in your teeth.

Two words - no value. Not going back there.

I read great things from a Montreal blogger so I wanted to see for myself what the fuss was about. 

I dropped by on a Friday afternoon (around 3:30pm) for a late lunch and was surprised to see it was reasonably busy. Good sign. 

I like how their menu is short and sweet. Only 14 items on the menu!

- Bun bo hue ($9.75 large) - two sizes to choose from (small and large) so obviously I went with the latter. Unfortunately, the only difference (to me) is that you get more soup rather than more meat or more noodles. 

Broth was tasty but I instantly tasted MSG/salt. The level of heat was pretty fiery with the first few sips but eventually subsided. Noodles were good (but wish they gave more). The best was the beef slices; perfect fat to meat ratio and it stayed incredibly tender the whole time I was eating. They even put in pork blood; pretty authentic/legit.

For those who are not experienced in BBH it's a spicy beef noodle soup in a rich broth. Think of it as Pho's angrier cousin. Rich beef broth with noodles and a healthy spicy kick to it. Another way I can explain BBH is it's quite possibly the best way to clear a full sinus cavity. Thus it makes a delicious meal in the cooler months where we have those wet humid 0C to -10C days. You know the days I'm talking about.......where you feel chilled to the bone and you feel like curling up under a blanket or blasting the heat just to warm up. Go get a steamy bowl of Bun Bo Hue and PRESTO. Instant feel better. 

For those who are Vietnamese purists this is a delicious option in a town where Vietnamese food is plentiful. Absolutely I shall be back. Without a question. 

****** Word of caution. BBH is not a first date meal. It is only if you state ground rules that you eat like a hungry dog. 

****** Second word of caution. Don't wear a white shirt as those red oil stains (from the soup) are near impossible to get out. I made an impromptu bib out of paper towel (yes I'm comfortable in my own skin).

We had the grilled chicken plate (chicken, rice, salad, fish sauce) and the special Bun Bo Hue (a spicy beef noodle soup). Both were quite tasty. I probably would ask them to hold the blood cube next time (just a personal preference), but I didn't mind it too much. 

Service was great, feels like a small family place the folks in the neighborhood like to frequent.

Today, I passed by Sen Vang .. A tiny place which is located just in front of Metro Côte-Ste-Catherine (you can't miss it out! they have a big green billboard lol). I ordered a beef bowl of Pho. The ingredients are fresh, the meat is super tender and just the smell of if will make you salivate.

The beef seasoned broth served along rice noodles, thinly sliced beef, meatballs, tendon, is authentic and close to what you would expect from a homemade concoction - easy on the cloves and lean on the fat content.

You will also find your staple choices of egg noodle with bbq pork and shrimp soup, various rice or rice vermicelli dishes with grilled chicken, pork, beef and the famous vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk. 

Recently inspired from my foodie friend's posting, I was intrigued and had to stop and try it out. Although only officially inaugurated two weeks ago, owners Son & Thao are working out the usual minor opening related kinks but this seems to be a promising outlet for soups & noodle cravings!

Definitely must return to try ""off-menu"" items such as Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef and thick noodle soup) or Bun Rieu  (crab and noodle soup). What surprises do the friendly Sen Vang (Golen Lotus) owners Son and Thao await us on our next visit?Come and find out for yourself!","4 star rating"

Their soup is tasty, the broth is just salty enough, without being over the top. The portions are just right.

Their beef is fresh and yummy and so is their grilled chicken.

Their vermicelli dishes are a tad too big for my tummy (not that that's stopped me from gleefully wolfing them down anyway) and their prices do reflect the larger portion size. They're so big you could pretty much split one between two people and have a smaller dish on the side.

I tried one of their rice dishes, their simplicity and savouriffic salaciousness was succulent and satisfying. Seriously, the grilled chicken on rice did not disappoint.

Their prices for pho soups are very reasonable, so that definitely keeps me coming back, it's a real no brainer to eat here frequently.

I gotta say for a local eatery in the cote sainte Catherine neighbourhood, I'm surprised how good it is. I even prefer it to the slightly upmarket Hai Hoang up the road. The quality, value, and friendly service, everything is just how I like it.

To start off, this place isn't your fancy restaurant for big dates, but it has a nice little ""mom's recipes"" kind of vibe, a tiny neighbourhood restaurant. Its very comforting, the paintings on the walls and the small music playing in the back give it a really nice atmosphere. 
The service was very quick! I got my food faster than I took time ordering it. The menu is extremely simple (for the pho, there was only3-4 different flavors which were all beef). The main pho is at a pretty nice price, the sides are a bit more pricy for their size.

I tried their Bun Bo Hue, and it was AMAZING. I would say it's in the top 2 I've ever had in Montreal. It was really hot, full of flavour and definitely authentic. 

The chef came out and even spoke to my boyfriend and I about how he tries to make the soup as authentic as possible and how he aims for the soup to be consistent every single time it is ordered (at some places when you go it can be good on one day, a tad watery or oily the next). He was very friendly and definitely showed a true passion for cooking.

It's going to be hard to even try anything else on the menu because I think I'll just keep on ordering the bun bo hue :)","5 star rating"

Here goes.

Location:
- Right across Métro Cote-Sainte-Catherine
- Easily reachable by Highway (near Decarie Highway)
- Parking is easy to find and free on Victoria Street

Food:
- Pho: Delicious and unique. You may think that all Pho taste the same, but I'm very pleased with their soup bowls. Generous quantity, prepared to perfection, soup was boiling hot every time I order a great bowl of pho.
- Haven't tried their Bun (Vermicelli) and Com (Rice) yet. I will re-review this in the future.

About the restaurant:
- Family owned business with professional service
- Can get very busy in lunch times, that doesn't bother me because it tells me that this place is popular and is great.
- Price range is exceptionally affordable.

Anyhow, this deserves a 4.75 star - and 5 is closest to it so I give it a five.

Definitely will be returning in the future.","5 star rating"

The food is not only well priced but high quality. The broth was very flavorful and comforting. It was the perfect way to start the day. We also got the ice coffee with condensed milk, it was very rich and tasted almost like a liquid hard coffee candy. If you have a sweet tooth I would definitely try the coffee. The service was also very quick and easy. You can sit and eat for an hour or grab a quick meal. Would definitely go back.","5 star rating"

Awesome food, an incredibly friendly staff, it's easy to find, and it doesn't empty your wallet. That pretty much sums up the qualities and pros of Sen Vang. 

The menu covers the basics of Vietnamese cuisine and does an amazing job of everything. I had the rare beef pho, and the flavor of the broth was simply sublime in it's mix of sweet and salty. The quality of the ingredients is definitely higher than some other Vietnamese restaurants in town and I could tell instantly that great care was taken in the preparation of the food as the beef was not stuck together is it can tend to be, and there were generous portions of noodles and beef in the bowl. 

One of the hidden gems by far. Definite 5 stars","5 star rating"

If you've never heard of it, it's a spicy (obviously from the picture) beef based soup that a lot of places serve on the weekend. The broth's balance of salty, sour, sweet and savoury balances on a fine line where a little bit in either direction will throw the soup off completely. There is a profound depth of flavour in this noodles dish, fragrant in lemongrass and spices, the toppings are similar to the dac biet, with the addition of black pepper ""cha lua"" - Vietnamese steamed pork loaf, the same that's found in banh mi, however, the rice noodles in this dish are thicker and cylindrical.","4 star rating"

Had an early dinner after wandering Montreal. We had hot and sour soup, Imperial Shrimp, Kung Pao chicken, and Thai crispy noodles with seafood. The shrimp dish had ample shrimp, but was bland. Once we added some soy sauce and chili oil, it was good. Kung Pao was okay, again under-flavored. The crispy noodle dish was a star, good flavor and great texture contrasts between the juicy seafood and crispy noodles. The hot and sour soup was the bomb. Well seasoned, well flavored, and just the right amount of spice. We ordered the house red (picture attached), it was good and tasty.

We would return when in the area again.","5 star rating"

When we ordering, the server must not have heard us adjust our order and ended up bringing us a dish we no longer wanted. 
Evidently, their problem solving skills amounted to shoving it on the table without any apology and just insisting that we take it. 
And throughout the course of our supper, not once did anyone offer to come by and change our plates, in spite of the fact that by the end of our meal, all of the many bland tastes had unfortunately blended together into one gigantically bland soupy mess. 
Needless to say, we were glad to reinforce that gratuities are not mandatory for clearly subpar service.","1 star rating"

My husband had the most delicious Hot & Sour Soup. We wanted to  take some home to our local takeout joint and say....Make this! Mushrooms and tofu and real pork and shrimp (gasp!) I don't even like Hot & Sour Soup and I was stealing bites. 

I had an eggroll. You could tell it was handmade and handrolled. It was crispy and wonderful. I had General Tso's Chicken since that is my Chinese jam. It was great. Not the sickening sweet stuff of home. Just good crispy and slight spicy and sweet. The house fried rice was the average dish of the night.

How about that Chinese crave you've been hiding for a week now?. 
I was happy to see this restaurant open late and glad that they had what I was looking for.
I ordered the bbq pork appetizer with the shrimp and corn soup. 
What is the definition of full? That soup. I was handed a bowl 2 times the size of my head with a lot of broth. I was a little disappointed with the noodles because they were thinner then I expected. 
Also the pork was a little dry but it's based with a sauce which you can put on to help.
Overall this seems like a good place to get that crave. I hope when it's busy the food is a bit better but I was still happy when I left.

Typical, super noisy, large open room, that has too many tables and chairs packed into it. We ordered the Chicken Soo Guy. The server described Soo Guy as a 'special Asian sauce"" . . .UH, your typical sweet and sour sauce is not what I would call ""special"". . . sorry, didn't like it one bit.

I come from Vancouver where we have a very very large Chinese population, so I compare my experiences from Asian restaurants there.

Great food and good service for an Asian restaurant. There's a difference in service by cultural standards, so most western people don't understand that their food may come out at different times and to share their plates family style. 

We had some wonton soup, egg rolls, chow mein, a beef dish and the boneless crispy fried chicken. 

The wonton broth was SO light and delicious, no scum or floaties, talk about quality, and the wontons were nice and light. 

Egg Roll was properly fried and not greasy.  Same with the chicken.

We washed the above average food down with Tsing Tao. The food was hot, tasty and they made sure that no peanuts were present for our one diner who was allergic. 

Of course we ordered far too much food but that was intentional so that the student at our table had leftovers. For me Chinese food is a simple combination of freshness, look and taste.

It was late and there were a few restaurants still opened.  The streets were very quiet.  We went into the restaurant next door to Beijing Restaurant Inc but RAN OUT as soon as we saw their LUMINOUS sweet and sour chicken!  You probably could use it to illuminate your way out of a coal mine with that!!!!!!!  Was not too keen on Beijing Restaurant cos I am not a fan of northern chinese food (think thick doughy chewy dumplings!)- but then I was tired and hungry and I really did not want to walk around looking for food.  So it was off to Beijing next door.

Think the restaurant was named ""Beijing"" to sound Chinese but the food is more cantonese hong kong type cooking - nothing to do with northern chinese cooking or Beijing for that matter.  The owner spoke cantonese too.  So it was a good thing we walked in.

The food was excellent.  The portions were also huge so you are better off ordering just one dish per person for 2 or even share 2 dishes amongst 3.  Plenty!  The beef dish was tender and had that cooked over a high flame taste.  Yummy.  The fried shashimo with salt and peppers was delicious!  The congee was smooth and comforting as well.  Yum!  The free dessert of cut orange slices was a good end to a terrific meal.

The decor is simple but the place gets kinda crowded and you may be asked to share one of the bigger tables.  Was there late at round midnight and they were still doing a brisk business.  Great tip - they are opened till 3 am!  It seems like a lot of people come in for late night supper takeaways too.

Anyway I always come here for their beef tranch fries... Its not really listed in the menu, but you can always ask the waiter for salt and pepper beef with no sauce, or even customize any dish. Really. They have a potluck service going on so everyone is always helping your table not matter what and you wont feel left behind at all. I loved how my particular who made a point on smiling and nodding everytime he passed and asked if everything was okay, making sure he was attentive. And this happens consistently everytime I come here, any given time. 

The food itself is great! As a regular I always get the beef that I was talking about the corn chicken creamy soup and 2 sides that I always change around. One of my fav here is the cantonese fried chowmein. Its crispy with enough chicken around.

We showed up around 6:30pm, the restaurant was already pretty full. We were asked if we had reservations, we said we did not and the guy walked over to a table with a reserved sign on it and seated us. We were brought Chinese tea with our menus. The tea was surprisingly good. I find the tea served in most Chinese restaurants to be flavorless and glorified pale colored water, however this tea was full of flavor and was a welcome change.

Once seated, we begin to look over their menu. There is plenty to choose from and there is something for everyone's taste and their menu has one of the largest selection of vegetarian options available that I have ever seen and was more than just something and tofu as you find in most places. We spent a few minutes picking our dishes and the waiter came over, confirmed everything with me about what I had written.

My wife ordered a wonton soup, but it was enough for the both of us. My parents ordered a small Hot & Sour soup, that was more than enough for the both of them. Our main course consisted of General Tao Chicken, Shrimp Chop Suey, Seafood Fried Rice, Beef Chow Ho, and my father got a bowl of steamed rice.

My mother was worried we didn't order enough, but than again she's always worried there will not be enough food. However, there was more than enough to go around and at the end of the meal, it was more gluttony that was making me pick at the plates, than anything else.

My favorite dish was the Beef Chow Ho, it had a beautiful smoky taste to it, that was absolutely divine. The Seafood Fried rice was made up of small scallops, shrimp, and what seemed to be mock crab. The General Tao was good, but it could have been a little spicier for my taste, but it was nicely cooked and not soft and mushy like I have had at other places.

All in all, for the four of us, with 4 Tsingtao beers, with tax and tip it came to just under 90$. If we hadn't had the beers, the price would have been a lot more reasonable, because the beers alone were 23$. The service was quick and the food was great. All in all, I look forward to my next visit to try some of the dishes I saw at other tables while I was walking out.","4 star rating"

There were six of us and we ended up ordering something different each and then just eating family style-like.  

Everything was good and I was most impressed with the fried dishes as they were not deep friend and heavy, but lightly pan friend and you could taste the chicken/shrimp.  

Of course it is typical ""Western"" Chinese and what one would expect to find in the States at non authentic restaurants.  Service was very good, especially when one of our friends got sick and had to head back to the hotel (not from the food!!).  Prices were on the low side especially for the amount of food served.

If your a fan of Chinese cuisine this place is a must. You know it's going to be a good meal when most of the people in the place are Chinatown residents and most of the conversations around you are being held in Chinese. 

This is the kind of restaurant that lends it's self well to group outings, I always seem to eat here in large groups I find the round tables with and lazy Susan's make it easy to share dishes and try new things. 

The food here isn't always to my taste but that's more of a preference thing then a quality of food thing. I like Beijing because the menu has a wide variety of dishes, a little something for everyone, whether you want the old standards like General Tao chicken and chicken fried rice to pickled cabbage and vegetarian hot pots.

The decor is standard old School Chinese restaurant chairs and tables out of the 70's, waiving cats and half the menu written on pieces of cardboard taped to the wall.  Until recently the menu items on the wall were only written in Chinese. The dated decor give along with the divers clientele give Restaurant Beijing a great ambiance.

I don't even think there is a chef there at lunch time. I would guess it's manufactured food reheated.  It may be cheap but I stay away.

At night however, the chefs are in and there are some definite gems on the menu.  Although I've been there over a dozen times I don't think I've sampled a tenth of their offerings.

My favorites are anything in black bean sauce as well as their crab in ginger and shallot sauce (they bring you the live crab to approve before preparing it).  Their salt and pepper shrimps are also good but the ones at Hot and Spicy (see review) are better.

It is a small place and tables are small and very close together, except for the 2 large round tables that can accommodate groups of up to 12.

The owner and host always seems to remember you even if you came only once before.  Also on the nights where it's very busy, he will tell you how long the wait and remember you, without taking your name down, when you come back after walking around in Chinatown.

Service is fast, efficient and polite.  When the restaurant is very busy, they will however remove your finished plates and give you the check quickly.","4 star rating"

Our winter Melon soup came with winter melon seriously under cooked.

Our Yeung chow fried rice wasn't using day old rice and pees were rock hard (don't serve freezer burned pees & carrot ?)

And frankly this is almost an institution as far as I am concerned.

Upon arriving you are given a pencil and a sheet of paper of which you write down the number of your orders. then the server review it and the fun begins ...

While I can't say I have tasted everything on their extremely extensive menu. I have sampled quite a bit.

Here's my list of favorite :

Sizzling lemon chicken : 'usually coming smoking hot from the kitchen on your table, the taste is incredible and a must have ... and I don,t usually like lemon flavored anything :)'

Chicken Corn soup : if you are only 2 people or less order a small or medium bowl as the large... IS large ... That soup is the ultimate feel good food like a warm balnket in front of a cozy fire in the winter.

Hot and Sour soup : one  of the dest I ever tasted

Sesame Beef ; General Tso Chicken : excellent and very fresh and good.

Also a good sign a lot of asian people eat there !!.

We tried a variety of dishes, all of which were on par or excellent.  I was surprised to be able to order Beijing (Peking) duck at 11:30pm but we were, and when they brought the whole duck to show to us before they prepared the dishes, there was a noticeable hush in the restaurant.  We noticed quite a few ducks getting sold after that.

Other dishes that were especially well done were the salt and pepper squid, and the spicy peanut butter dumplings, which they do with oyster sauce.  They also have a surprisingly large and diverse menu, with a large-ish vegetarian selection.

The atmosphere is on par with most Chinese restaurants.  The restaurant is particularly busy late at night but there is a fair amount of turnover so we didn't have to wait too long either night.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the place has the air of a family-run business.

One can undoubtedly find more pretentious, and more expensive, Chinese restaurants (say, in Vancouver), but Beijing delivers very well on standard Cantonese fare.","4 star rating"

Order the chicken congee, Choy sum vegetables, and anything with black bean sauce in it. Flavors are consistent for a late nite but not all too salty that you can't taste the food.

The topping was too hard to bite and I found a human hair under the topping. No smile on the owner looking couples' faces too.

What a wonderful surprise the Beijing is! We have gone back to this restaurant every time we visit Montreal, usually 2 - 3 times a year, and often we will eat there more than once during the trip.

Favorite dish: General Tso's Chicken - crispy, tangy, yummy
Favorite rice: Chicken fried rice - wonderful flavor
Soup: Won Ton soup - clear broth, yummy dumplings
Egg Rolls: Crisp, golden, delicious

The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is you do have to make sure when you go. If it's busy, the food is very fresh and particularly good. If you go during an off time, the food is not always at its best. We've never had a bad meal, however, and when we bring friends they all rave.

Although my horizons have been broadened by SGV, I have to say that this will be the standard by which other chinese food is measured (ie. is it absolutely positively delicious). We always start out with seafood bean curd soup (what we always referred to as Pa Bo Bean Curd Soup and chinese won ton soup...since we have been going here for almost 30 years, not sure whether this is the correct name or just tolerance on their part)...just perfect with a little siracha. Then comes the onslaught of dishes including ginger lobster, beef with thick rice noodles in black bean sauce, steamed sole with ginger and shallots, shrimps with lobster sauce, snow pea leaves, watercress, baby bak choy, and a few random dishes we may try. This place is a must for me...one of the places that makes Montreal home and I never miss a chance to eat here when I am back in town. This place is definitely not for those on a diet cos they are not shy with the oil it seems...but worth every bite!  

There is only street parking and it is limited so be warned if you try to come here on a busy day like Xmas or weekends, etc. As well, street parking is now $6 for 2 hours (!!!!!)...the only saving grace to this travesty by the idiotic councilmembers is that you can use your credit or debit card to pay. Other than that, I'm just gonna rant a little about the morally reprehensible device employed by the municipal council to maximize their revenue, only to misuse the funds in such imbecilic maneuvers as ""renaming all the english streets into french names"". Instead of using the money to fix the streets, there are giant, extremely hazardous potholes everywhere so that the overpaid, extremely bored councilmembers can come up with other useless measures in a bid to rid the city of all traces of english. Unfortunately, in their bid to preserve the french language, they ensure its demise; who wants to keep around a language whose speakers are so annoying?","5 star rating"

Like an ancient Chinese secret passed down from generation to generation, it was my ex who showed me this place first a decade ago, and I have since then passed on the torch and introduced some of my friends to it. 

Before 2013, the restaurant used to be named Soupe et Nouilles but it was re-branded Nouilles Star, around the same time it started charging taxes and they redid their interior design, taking down posters on their walls that dated back to a pre-2000 era.

The place looks like nothing much, just another low-key Chinese restaurant. The service is ultra-fast and the food you order will unmistakably land in front of you in a delay of 5-10 minutes maximum. Sometimes less. 

The waiters are generally not very expressive, so do not expect a five-star hotel service on that front; they are practical and quick however, and the food is very cheap, so it works in their favor.

Now, in regards to the food... I can vouch for the General Tao (Chicken or Tofu if you are vegetarian) and the fried rice section of their menu. They are, in my opinion, freaking delicious. My taste buds make a jig every time I eat there, and I leave feeling strangely fulfilled after every visit. Whatever else you order, it's at your own risk. You've been warned, Yelpers!

Nouilles Star is undeniably one of my favorite hidden gems in the city, but it's not for everyone. If you seek fancy food, stay the hell away. If you seek filling Chinese food that tastes good, go get yourself a General Tao. You're welcome.

P.S. This restaurant is cash-only. There is an ATM at the front door with a fee of $1.85 per transaction.","4 star rating"

We ordered Pékin duck (served with rice or noodles by choice) and seafood noodles. 
You know what, it's not a special restaurant but it's acceptable for lunch or diner after school. 
This restaurant is located near Concordia Uni and the price is affordable, just 12 or 13 for a diner outside. Not too bad.

Service: SPEEDY GONZALEZ level.. aha they are fast and friendly they get orders out and are all working on the wok like machines its fun to watch! 

Food: Deeeelicious makes my belly happy and I must say they've upgraded their containers so no more leaking spills in the bag Finallly ! I love their shrimp and lobster sauce woow its always amazingly fresh and tender ! I love their peanut butter dumplings definitely worth to try! 
So if you're looking for chineese and something not out of the ordinary this place is where you should be. Its no fancy shmancy place quite the opposite but their food & service seriously speak volume!

When i asked the serve what happened to less oil and no onions and make it more spicy. He began screaming to the kitchen in chinese and attempted to take my dish away. I was afraid he might tamper with my food after i complained tht they did everything TOTALLY OPPOSITE, of what i just asked for. I dont trust their ass taking my dish back in and giving me a new one that may include some extra ingredients... if you know what i mean. 
The sweet and sour soup was super sour. It was very ""bamboo"" ish.. not my style and i didnt want to take a second taste.

The good: Food is terrific! Everything we ordered tasted great! Service was friendly. Waitress was answering all of our questions. 

The bad: CASH ONLY!!! (ATM at entrance) There are random pictures of models on the wall which is odd. Seating hard and uncomfortable. Can be a VERY busy place (but we were lucky that night).

Like an ancient Chinese secret passed down from generation to generation, it was my ex who showed me this place first a decade ago, and I have since then passed on the torch and introduced some of my friends to it. 

Before 2013, the restaurant used to be named Soupe et Nouilles but it was re-branded Nouilles Star, around the same time it started charging taxes and they redid their interior design, taking down posters on their walls that dated back to a pre-2000 era.

The place looks like nothing much, just another low-key Chinese restaurant. The service is ultra-fast and the food you order will unmistakably land in front of you in a delay of 5-10 minutes maximum. Sometimes less. 

The waiters are generally not very expressive, so do not expect a five-star hotel service on that front; they are practical and quick however, and the food is very cheap, so it works in their favor.

Now, in regards to the food... I can vouch for the General Tao (Chicken or Tofu if you are vegetarian) and the fried rice section of their menu. They are, in my opinion, freaking delicious. My taste buds make a jig every time I eat there, and I leave feeling strangely fulfilled after every visit. Whatever else you order, it's at your own risk. You've been warned, Yelpers!

Nouilles Star is undeniably one of my favorite hidden gems in the city, but it's not for everyone. If you seek fancy food, stay the hell away. If you seek filling Chinese food that tastes good, go get yourself a General Tao. You're welcome.

P.S. This restaurant is cash-only. There is an ATM at the front door with a fee of $1.85 per transaction.","4 star rating"

Their soups are more than satisfying and ever so delicious. I like that they are willing to put many Chinese vegetables on the menu, like Gai Lan, Dou Miao and Foo Gua which are hard to find in Chinese restaurants in the States located outside of a traditional Chinatown. The dumplings with peanut sauce is a unique dish quite different from other similar preparations I have had, that alone is reason enough to go and give this restaurant a try. I don't understand the star ratings sometimes, particularly when I have dined in a place for years and have been more than satisfied, it leaves me puzzled.

I walked in and felt confident that this would satiate my craving, seeing a bunch of Middle Eastern, Desi, and African clientele. Surely, such a diverse group would promise spicy goodness? WRONG!
I order the seafood hot pot which came with a bowl of steamed rice and the Malaysian Thai Basil Seafood noodles. Underwhelming and probably undercooked. They only accept cash and $30 for a pretty mediocre meal didn't put me in the best mood.

Service: First, you almost always have to wait if you go during peak hours, but if you show up at some random time like say, 1:47pm, you can get a table. The service is OK but don't expect super friendly staff. They're very efficient mind you, but I suspect that being consistently busy and working in a confined space means that no chit chat will be included in the price. In any case, service is pretty quick so if you're in a hurry, you're all set. 

Place: It's small and not much to look at. On one side you get takeout and on the other, you can sit in to eat. Posters of random Asian pop stars adorn the walls. I don't know any of them but I'm sure they're just great!

The food: I've been going there since like, 1995. Seriously. I love this place. The food is cheap, the portions are huge and I personally have never had a negative experience here. I always order the Cantonese wonton noodle soup - it's bloody huge and I can never eat it all, but on a cold winter's day it really hits the spot. The wontons are pork and shrimp..... YUM!

We've been here  in its previous incarnation and we had mixed reviews. We come for F1 and stay a week to experience all Montreal has to offer. The first year we tried this place we found it quaint yet I felt that something was not quite right with my chicken wing appetizer. ...  As if it wasn't quit good but not enough for sure to say it was bad. 

The next year I swore to try it again and everything was ok and in fact pretty good. Now I'd like to state at this time (2011) it was very late and so super busy that we barely got in. We actually waited a reasonable time to get our meals and by that I mean 5mins or so.  

This year we are late going in that it's the last day of he weekend festivities and we are super early for Montrealer's eating time (7ish).  Now the bad part....I will NEVER come back here again. My husband ordered the pork spring rolls as an appetizer and that dish is the best we have to write about but even that was delivered in less than 30 sec. Yup I'm not kidding.   Then a true test for me of any place ....the hot & sour soup.  Gross. I mean bad but I kept at it hoping I am wrong; you know when you keep thinking ""we'll maybe another spoonful"". I left it half empty and they didn't ask why.  The main dishes. My husbands Orange Beef came again in seriously 30 sec to 1 min absolutely tops. It is so heavily coated like a bad chicken ball from some dive and I wonder how did they do that in less than a min from appetizer end?????  You can figure that out.  Then the worse part - my main dish #79 garlic spicy beef and I'm looking forward to all that it says.  Oh my Lord gross gross.  It was so heavenly laden with salt and/orMSG that i could not eat it and I did try.  No one came to ask how any thing was and this even tho the place was not even half full. When they came to get the plates it was obvious that my plate was barely touched but still no questions. So I say ""that was terrible and so full of salt it was unbearable"". He smiled, left, and brought us the bill for the full amount. 

I left $1 tip.  Not sure they got the message or if they whether they care; somehow I doubt it","1 star rating"

It's now called Noodle Star. I used to come here  years ago and it was decent. I ordered the chicken pad thai tonight. I actually ended up throwing most of it out, something that my friends know me NEVER to do, I always eat everything on my plate. This was barely edible: very low quality chicken, gristly, it had small bones and crunchy ligaments. I'm never eating here again.

I agree with the review below, if I could give zero stars I would. Now I'm starting to wonder if that gristly meat was actually rat.","1 star rating"

I went to this restaurant last night around their closing time, Waiter come to me with menu and asked rudely to order fast as they are closing. I order quickly for one Pad Thai noodles. They gave me a another order saying it's Pad Thai. I always eat Pad Thai and that was not a Pad Thai for sure but i managed to eat that. While eating he gave me my cheque expecting me to leave fast. My bill was 11 CAD and they don't except cards so i paid by Cash. I paid 15 CAD. The waiter didn't came up with my change assuming that it goes into tip. So my change was technically ""36%"" which was the potential tip. I asked another waiter to bring my change he got pissed off. He kept the change on my table and said where is my tip? I said not for this service not today. His literal words were
"" Why you INDIANS have to be so cheap? You guys are so Cheap"" He abused and showed offensive gestures.
Deep inside I knew he was being a beggar and asking for tip ; the worst part was when the fight started the other waiter also joined him and they start yelling for INDIAN community which was way too offensive.

The kimchi fries were not even in the slightest spicy and honestly didn't really taste like kimchi! Cheeseburger and mushroom ""scallops"" was the only thing with some flavor. The mushroom burger on the other hand  was more fried batter than mushroom. Over fried and the burger was so dry. 

Now the ""spicy"" tacos? It was burnt on the bottom and absolutely flavorless. The tofu was soggy and the guacamole was flavorless. We asked for extra aioli, that never arrived. We wanted mocktails, they were all out! Instead was recommended a lemonade which was so overpowered by a strong ginger flavor! It was so difficult to drink it.

Some solid dishes at this vegetarian restaurant with nice ambience but it wasn't one of our best meals in Montreal. The service was so so, it took almost 20 minutes between the soup and our second courses. And they totally didn't follow our request on bringing things our 1-2 dishes at a time. The pairing of the dishes was a bit bizarre, with poutine and onion rings at the end.

MUST HAVE'S:
Pea quinoa cake - light and airy full of spring flavors from little peas. Well-executed and delightful.

SOLID:
gazpacho - typical standard fare
Cari cacao - rice with curry carrot, squash, kale, and cashew. Comfort food. Good to share. 

SKIP:
Fried onion rings - the onion rings are too thick and big and the the fried dough around the onion rings was not crispy.

Vegan poutine - this one was sweet potato fries with soy sauce-based gravy and tofu like imitation cheese on top.  The alteration from the real poutine was disappointing. We wished that we just order sweet potato fries on its own instead.

Gnocchi - pesto gnocchi on a bed of arugula. The combination of the ingredients didn't quite make sense. Texture of the gnocchi was quite good but i didn't love the pesto sauce.","3 star rating"

I've heard from Olivia Wilde forever ago how amazing Montréal is for vegan food. I knew that was a priority when we decided to come to MTL for a quick weekend getaway. 

LOV is a formidable contender on both yelp and Google searches. We made a reservation at the most convenient time available at late notice: 9pm. 

After a few pregame drinks, we arrived to find a mostly full restaurant, even at that hour on a Saturday night. 

The menu is outrageous. After some deliberation, we arrived at our selections. I guess it was busy enough that our server kept us waiting to order for a hot minute. Another server either by pure observational skills or bc they overheard me express my impatience, came over to take our orders. 

For drinks I ordered the lilikoi with tequila, passion fruit, mango, lime, and pistachio. Tina ordered a Moscow mule. Hers was standard, nothing special, but mine was AMAZING. I would've ordered another one if I had the opportunity. 

For our actual meal, I absolutely had to try vegan poutine. It's listed a side, so don't experience the wave of terror that I went through after I couldn't find it in the appetizers. This frankly was one of the best things I have ever had the pleasure of placing on the tiny tongue protrusions that make up my taste buds. The ""gravy"" is incredibly flavorful, so much so that I scooped up the remnants with my fork afterwards. The cheese curds were not as satisfying as real cheese obviously but did the trick. The fries were crisp. I would eat this way too often if I lived in MTL. 

We ordered the banh mi burger and the gnocchi di casa for our mains. The burger was INCREDIBLE. The tofu was thick, breaded and flanked with slaw. An explosion of flavors. 

The gnocchi was tasty as well. I detected a slightly nutty tone. They were engulfed in a delicious pesto sauce and dusted with parm. 

This place has amazing food. The service leaves something to be desired but the food is so fantastic it makes up for the service issues.","5 star rating"

I ordered the gnocchi and it might've been the best gnocchi I've ever had, even compared to others that have had actual cheese. It was incredible. The smoothies were decent, and the coffee offerings were great. The service staff were awesome--super friendly and ready to assist however they could. We never felt rushed, but only felt welcomed. Also, I could go on and on about the atmosphere here. Check out the pictures of the interior and you'll see what I'm talking about. 

Literally the only downside is the higher prices, but I suppose you get what you pay for. A great spot that we'd come to an embarrassing amount of times if we lived closer.","5 star rating"

We booked here in advance for dinner and it was a good thing. Friday evening and the place was packed with a line at the door! 

I LOVE the decor. It is all white with old wood, old windows, baskets, yellow lights... I mean it was just stunning inside. Felt so fancy even though I was just in sweatpants. The staff is amazing. So kind and so attentive. They seat you, they clear your plates, they even unnecessarily cleared and replaced our cutlery once. It was quite an experience. A++

I got an alcoholic chai/chocolatey tea. It was okay. We split poutine and kimichi (?). The rice ball and grilled cauliflower was decent, sauce could have used a touch more flavor. The poutine was ok. I had had some better poutine earlier in the day but overall I would get it again. I got the cheeseburger. This was also good. I think it may have been a bean burger, very dense... but a lovely fluffy bun and melted cheese and sauce. Montreal seems to know how to do burger sauce well. The cesar salad was awesome, finally some vegan croutons. 

For dessert I tried the chocolate icecream, which is mostly a coconut base and yet doesnt taste like coconuts so yay! I tried the creme brule, I honestly do not think Ive ever had it before, even nonvegan- YUM. Way yum. I took a bite of brownie, didnt love it. I took a bite of cheesecake and didnt like that. 

Overall I would say the food is in general OKAY. The decor and staff were great!! The price is.... very very expensive. Appetizers, meals, desserts, and a drink each for 3 people was $200. Perhaps the most expensive bill Ive paid. I will not do that again anytime soon but I am very happy with the experience and would encourage you to go!!","4 star rating"

The ambiance, the decor, the food, everything! I was so surprised that there are so many vegan restaurants in Montreal, AND they are good! It's hard to get in this restaurant without reservation. I'd definitely suggest anyone who wants to try it out to spend a few minutes to make a reservation online. 
The staff is very friendly attentive and sweet. We had risottos, lasagna, truffles caviar mushroom, and poutine. Every single dish was delicious and surprising, especially the seasoning on the crispy oyster mushroom was a must try!

Ambiance: this is why I'm giving the restaurant a 4 star. The decorations were quite charming and the way everything is placed was lovely. There were a row of swings, a fresh flower on each table and the general atmosphere was pleasant. I would come here from celebratory occasions to a casual meet up with a friend. The service was polite and attentive. 

Food: this aspect of the restaurant irks me a little. I ordered sweet potato friends and they came out covered in salt, which overpowered the sweetness of the sweet potato. My risotto came out a bit cold and it was good, but isn't on par with other risottos that I've had. It lacked flavour and creaminess. 

Overall, good experience, especially for vegetarians/vegans.","4 star rating"

I got the veggie LOV burger. It was around $14, pretty reasonable until I found out that it did not come with some sort of side dish such as french fries. Although the LOV special sauce was tasty, the burger lacked flavour.

If you do plan on going to this restaurant for its unique meal preference (vegan), I would recommend getting a side dish to accompany any main meal as they are not filling enough (the waitress had to even suggest to almost everyone that the meal they respectively chose would most likely not be enough food). 

The atmosphere is quite nice, beautiful area in old Montreal. The restaurant has a ""Cali beach side"" feel to it which is nice.","3 star rating"

However, I'm allergic to dairy so I was so excited when my cousin showed me this vegan restaurant. 
When we stepped in, the decor immediately attracted me. It has cute swing seats in the back and hanging plants at the front windows. 

I ordered the almond milk cappuccino, cream cheese bagel, gnocchi, big lov burger, curry, and of course the poutine. The cappuccino was pretty good. There was nothing special to the curry. My favorite was the big lov burger and the poutine. The big lov burger is probably the best vegan burger I've ever tasted. Usually the patty gets pretty dry but this burger was very juicy. My cousin said the poutine does not taste the same as real poutine but it still tasted good! Just different. 

For dessert, I ordered the blueberry cheesecake and that was amazing! Like the poutine, it doesn't taste exactly like real cheesecake but it is very good. The consistency is the same! I really enjoyed it. 

I would definitely come back again if I visit Montreal! I think this restaurant is a must if you eat vegan food or want to try vegan food!","5 star rating"

I didn't find this out until later. This was very unfortunate because I was very much looking forward to trying vegan poutine and because our back up plans failed until the end of our trip. Nevertheless, my boyfriend and I ended up sharing a very delicious apple french toast at LOV to jumpstart our Montreal vacation. Unfortunately because we were new to Canada, we hadn't fully grasped the USD to CAD rate. As a result, we thought our tiny french toast was a little pricey, but it only ended up being 12 USD with tip and tax, so we totally could've tried another delicious entree! With this knowledge in hand, I will most definitely be returning to LOV the next chance I have. With so many locations, including this one conveniently located in Downtown Montreal, it'll be hard not to!

Ok, not on TV. But as someone who just likes food full-stop, I appreciate deliciousness in all forms and Restaurant LOV delivers in spades, all dairy and meat free!

First off--holy moly is the space beautiful. It's truly stunning in there. It's bright and calming, with lovely foliage set against off-white walls. Lovely as can be!

Second--the food is quite tasty. The kombucha onion rings might have been some of the best onion rings I've ever had. They weren't heavy or overly greasy in the slightest and had a delicious crunch and flavor. The dipping sauce was a little bland but the rings were flavorful enough on their own that I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. But something extra to give it some oomph (siracha? garlic? herbs?) might really take it to the next level. I also had the LOV burger, which was also tasty. The patty was not dry in the slightest (which can happen with veggie burgers) and had great flavors/spices mixed in. It came with a vegan cheese, onion, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and a special sauce. Simple but quite good.

Service was a little on the slower side but my colleague and I were busy chatting and catching up so it was nice to not feel rushed. Although if you're in a hurry you might want to tell them up front.","4 star rating"

This place is trendy. I've seen countless Instagram pictures of their beautiful restaurant so I knew I was bound to visit at some point. 

First tip: Reserve a table!
The place is packed ! I went on a rainy Friday night but it was still full. We initially got seated at the bar while we waited for a table and it's so cramped there. We got changed to the high tables near the door which was better but not the best seats in the house. 

We ordered the kale mac and cheese, Buddha burger, Poutine, and the onion rings.  The food is AMAZING. The mac and cheese was especially remarquable. I'm a tough judge when it comes to mac and cheese but this one is one of my favourites. I can't even describe how good it was. 
The onion rings were really crispy which is my favourite kind. 
The Poutine was perfectly seasoned and warm. Super delectable. 

I can't comment on the burger because I only got a small bite but Adam said he got ""food sweats and that only happens when I eat good food"". If adam gets food sweats over vegan food, you know it's worth it. It makes him temporarily forget he's eating something meat free. 

The service is good. Given the demand it's ok if they forget certain things (water,napkins). I think they are very friendly though. They welcome you with a smile and serve you he best they can and don't seem overworked or unhappy. They also make recommendations and give you some tidbits of information about the restaurant and the kitchen which is fun!","5 star rating"

Beautiful presentation. Add the organic hot sauce they have to it. The sauce isn't hot by any means but has wonderful flavour.

The beet salad is really good, could do with a bit more beets. However very tasty none the less and a good sharing size. The lack of beets was probably due to the time we ordered the salad at. *see service comment as to why.

The service was ok. It took a bit to get our waitress to stop rushing away from us so we could order. We placed our drink orders and before I could order our enters she ran off, essentially while I was mid sentence. we ordered our entrees  and when we went to order our main courses she told us the kitchen was closed and we could order form the snack menu. She never told us the kitchen was closing and when we asked what time the kitchen closed at she said 3:00... when we asked it was 3:02!!!!!! It was a bit of an issue to have her at least ask the kitchen if they'd make our salad we wanted. She reluctantly asked and they graciously said yes. (YAAAY for awesome kitchen staff!) she gave my friend a lot of attitude about us missing the last call for the kitchen... all this could of been avoided had she just mentioned the last call for the kitchen was at 3:00.

Beside that little incident, she was pleasant but not really attentive and the restaurant wasn't overly busy so I don't see a reason for the lack of attention.

The decor of the restaurant is absolutely lovely. It's all white brick with pretty plants and it's very bright.

Would defiantly visit again; I can't wait to try more of the yummy looking food from the menu and I'm hoping the service is a bit better next time.  Would definitely recommend!","3 star rating"

-utterly decadent avocado/mushroom carpaccio with savory crisps. There's a hint of truffle in there as well that is not overbearing. Although we were sharing this (my friend had the mac and cheese which I tasted but didn't lov, so I pretty much kept this plate in front of me the entire time), I might have, no I definitely did, eat the entire thing! Divine! 

-Smoked. Beet. Sandwich. With. Pickles. WHAT? I thought I had given up beets forever after ODing on them on a juice fast but this sandwich is utterly incredible. I took a bite, intending only to taste it, but I ended up smashing in an entire half despite myself. Glad my friend could convince me to take a bite. What I loved was the smoky flavor mixed with the tang of pickles. The beets are thinly sliced and piled on and it was a pure lov affair for me.

-crispy giant juicy onion rings. Need I say more? OK, one thing: the creamy dipping sauce could use a kick... I'm a hot sauce fanatic and don't expect others to be, but say a smoky chipotle pepper might be added to spice things up?! Fireworks might ensue?!

As I mention above, not as much lov for the mac and cheese, but I'm a weirdo who doesn't lov mac and cheese at all. Lov's is good, don't get me wrong! The crispy kale makes it interesting & at an edible level so that it's not pure starch and creaminess (not the fault of any restaurant, this is purely a texture thing that doesn't appeal to yours, truly). So while I wouldn't order it again, I absolutely recommend it for mac and cheese lovahs! 

No lov for the risotto. Sadly a bit bland and without much bite to the arborio. The salt I added still didn't help, but I'm not gonna dwell on the negative and leave it at that. 

I so cannot wait to return to Montréal and get back to the Lov affair. It makes my little vegan heart so happy.","4 star rating"

I made reservations but needed to push back the time slightly, and they happily accommodated my request. 

I arrived to the bustling, fragrant atmosphere and was greeted immediately by the friendly staff. I saw LOV on an episode of Buzzfeed's 'Worth It', and I was so excited to try. I highly recommend getting reservations as it does get quite busy. 

The menu is not too large, but every dish is thoughtful and seems super tasty. Every dish here is vegetarian and some are vegan too - honestly the perfect type of restaurant for me. The decor is very nice - complete with aesthetic marble tables - though the indoor lighting is not the most ideal for food photography. They do have a patio which I would be open to trying in the future -  but it was a cooler night when I went. 

It was really hard to make choices, but I finally decided on kimchi fries as an appetizer and gnocchi as my main. The wait time for food preparation is a bit longer, but the restaurant was quite busy. 

The kimchi fries came out piping hot and crispy - but really what made the fries amazing was the aioli - it was made with a soy emulsion and tasted amazing. The gnocchi is also one of their most popular dishes and I have no regrets - it was satisfying as the filling wa sweet potato, yet light as it was made with a pesto sauce. 

The price point was also quite reasonable! I paid $30 after tax for 2 items. The atmosphere was a bit loud as the restaurant was narrow, but honestly LOV was great. Definitely a place to try in Montreal.","4 star rating"

The place was packed as was the terrace so you definitely need reservations! The venue itself, white wash stone walls, hanging light fixtures and tropical touches is pretty and charming. We sat at the bar which was comfortable but tight if you intend to eat many small plates at once.

Having been vegan for many years, my expectations were high! I can say that the food overall was good. The dishes are creative and refined compared to other vegan venues in Montreal. We ordered the kimchi fries, kale mac n' cheese, eggplants, and the Big LOV burger; the mac n cheese was a little dry but the rest was tasty and filling! 

The wine list is mostly composed of natural wines and they offer a good selection; it took us three tries before finding a good white wine and even at that, we were not convinced. Stick to the cocktails which are light and refreshing. 

The service was a little slow at first as it took a while to take our drink order but flowed better after our food order probably cause it had quieted down; the food literally came out in less than 10 minutes!!

Overall, it was a good experience but would mostly go back for a cocktail and burger if I were in this touristy area.","3 star rating"

The decor is bright and lovely. They have wicker baskets as the light fixtures, a few hanging seats, and plant wallpaper. The tables looked like marble on the tops, and overall had a really nice aesthetic. 

All the food we tried was tasty and plated nicely. The mac and cheese was creamy, even thought there wasn't any dairy. The dumplings were crisp on the outside and had a nice kick from the almond butter kimchi sauce. The hero 2.0 bowl was flavourful and a little bit spicy. I liked how each ingredient was cooked and not soaked in all the sauce. The bok choy was a bit crispy for the leaf part, and the broccoli still had some crunch. When we walked by another table, the onion rings looked good so we had one order. It was massive. It came with 5 huge onion rings. They were super crispy, but my mom found it to not be that flavourful on its own.

There were four of us, and we got appetizers, entries, and two deserts, so we got to sample probably half of the menu. What sets this place apart are strong flavors - they are not afraid of seasonings and a little spice, which makes food taste delicious. We tried two different veggie burgers and both were great - not just patties, but also sauces, bread, and condiments were just right. Tacos were very tasty, and the cold watermelon-based soup of the day was amazing. 

The service was very good as well - friendly, extremely attentive, but not overbearing. Our waitress knew a lot about their dishes and recommended a couple of things that we really liked after taking her time to ask what we like.

We got the vegan poutine, and my non-vegan boyfriend said it was better than any poutine he had ever had. I also got the French onion soup, but it didn't live up to my expectations and was on the bland side. The tempeh chili he ordered was tasty and the perfect amount of food, but it was also under seasoned and could have used a little more spice.

Location is prime for this place! In the heart of old port-I quickly fell in love with the decor - it was refreshing, white accent lit by candle light, baby's breath flowers, had this cool eclectic Swing chairs. 

Food was pleasantly priced in the evening menu: snacks starting at 4-9$, main course-up to 18$ on average. (Note my ratings on a scale of 5 *s)

The food on the other hand, lacks in comparison to everything else. 

Gnocchi was a bit dry but the pesto sauce was lovely. Poutine a little salty but the rest tasted nice. Mac and cheese was the same where it was a bit overly salted, the taste of it was average. I enjoyed the carrot and sweet potato soup of the day though! The dish presentations are very up to standard, and served very professionally which I really like.

I randomly went there because many restaurants in the neighbourhood were closed during the holidays. 

I went during lunch time, so it got crowded pretty quickly but I was seated right away without any reservations. I was catching up with an old friend so we were talking a lot, but our waiter was very patient with us and gave us time to check the menu. 

We decided to share the buffalo Brussels sprouts which was awesome and so tasteful! I had a dish called truffle and caviar, which were good but not my favourite. It got cold really easily (and I wasn't eating slowly) so it became unpleasant to eat at the end. 

Because we knew someone that worked in the kitchen, we were offered an assortment of desserts which was an amazing surprise. The cakes themselves were not the best, but the homemade ice creams (matcha and apple I believe) were delicious. 

I am not vegan but I do enjoy vegan food, and I think LOV is a great establishment for those with a vegan diet and those who just like to eat! There are many options on the menu and most of the time, you can't even tell there's no meat or dairy. 

The decor of the restaurant is breathtaking and very Instagram vibe. I had to remove a star however because the price is a bit hefty and the portions are not that big, but taking in consideration that it is located in the old port, it's not that bad. 

Overall, I would definitely come back and perhaps try their other locations (which is very convenient considering I'm not always in the old port) and I would hope to find more items on the menu that I fall in love with, as it hadn't happened yet.","4 star rating"

There is lighter stuff, and junk foody type stuff, and every time I'm there I feel like I'm gonna be judged for ordering ALL THE THINGS... Except it looks like a lot of people do :)

A vegetarian restaurant that really delivers on the vegetarian food. One of my friends hates vegetables didn't even notice that the food was made from only vegetables. Definitely try the poutine, which was very rich and delicious.

The restaurant is not very big and gets very crowded at dinner time and it might be hard to move around if you have a big party.

The reason I gave the restaurant three stars was because the service was very awful. The restaurant only had 3 waiters during rush hour and this was most definitely not enough because there were way too customers. We were completely ignored by our server and on the chance that he did speak to us, he was very condescending when it was apparent that we did not speak French.","3 star rating"

I was in the Old Port with relatives yesterday and figured it was about time I try the original location.

I have to admit, after having consecutive excellent experiences on de la Montagne, I had high hopes for the McGill location and, I have to say, I was slightly let down. The service was only OK and the presentation seemed to be off.

My ""Big LOV"" burger was brought out much later than the rest of my party's food. The bun was soggy and the contents were lopsided and falling out. The flavour was there, I will give them that, but the presentation and soggy bun were a big disappointment. Maybe they were having an off night? Either way, a $13 burger (with no sides) should not be soggy and falling apart!

Now that the negative is out of the way, here's why you still absolutely have to try LOV (maybe just skip the ""Big LOV"" burger). I've brought a handful of omnivore friends here and they've all been amazed by how delicious their plates are. Not to mention the cheesecake! Seriously. It doesn't matter how full we are from dinner, I always order a cheesecake for the table to share just to show them how delicious cashews can be! If I didn't tell them upfront that it's vegan, they would have no idea. It's really that good.

I really love LOV -- you'll find me there often. As a strict vegetarian with a handful of food intolerances, it's rare to find a place that is accommodating *and* truly delicious. Plant-based restaurants are far too often dismissed as flavourless hippie joints and LOV is proof that vegan doesn't have to be bland or cookie cutter. Thank you, Stéphanie Audet!","4 star rating"

The decor is very beautiful. its light, airy and elegant , they even have some tables at the back that have fancy wicker swings as seats. Really cute place for a casual date or to catchup with a friend in a nice atmosphere. Either way, definitely make reservations , since this place is pretty popular. We ordered some drinks and light nibbles. The Prosecco was nice and refreshing and a good sized portion , the drinks are reasonably priced , in the sense that they are no more expensive than alot of other places in the area. The Poutine was good , I was impressed with how flavourful the gravy was - however it said it was sweet potato poutine which it was not, the fries were decent. We also had the tempeh tacos , they were okay , nice texture and fresh ingredients but nothing out of the ordinary. The pricing for what you get is a little steep (not the biggest portions and the food wasn't overly impressive or standout to merit it). The staff was friendly and efficient so no complaints there. This was not a bad experience but not sure it would be my first choice. I would suggest to try this place more for a drink and some snacks as well as for some nice Instagram photos as opposed to a full meal.","3 star rating"

Visited Montreal over the weekend and decided to visit this place based on other yelp reviews and recommendations from bloggers and had one of the best bunch in Montreal. I would recommend making a reservation if you mind sitting on the communal table or at the bar, we do not mind that and sometimes enjoy sitting at the bar as we did here. It gives you an opportunity to interact with the bartenders and servers more(understand that locals might not want to do it but we enjoyed that as tourists.). the staff was really friendly and delight to talk.

The place was amazing and definitely Instagram worthy and friendly (See Pics). 
Let's start with food now:
Soy Milk Mocha - 5/5

As it's been said before, the space is stunning (I'd argue the cutest restaurant I've been to in a while.) The food, by Montreal standards, was some of the best vegan fare I've had in a long time. We enjoyed the kale mac n' cheese, the nougatella tartine, and the poutine. I really hate daiya cheese so I really appreciate that these guys make all of their own plant-based cheeses. Needless to say, there wasn't a lousy plate in the lot. We also walked away only paying $14 each!

As other folks have noticed, the service is pretty slow. I'd argue though that if you're not in a rush it's worth the wait. Honestly, it's the only thing distinguishing this as a four star as opposed to a five star.

It is so aesthetically pleasing as soon as you step in. The service is incredible too. Our waiter was all smiles and extremely friendly. I ordered a Lov mimosa and my SO ordered a beer. 
For appetizers, we ordered the dumplings. They were completely fried and stuffed with mushrooms and veggies. They were crisp and soft on the inside. The wrapper wasn't the same traditional dumpling wrapper. It fried differently. For mains, We ordered their version of Pho and the truffle and caviar. 
The pho was so different and surprising. I really enjoyed it. It packed a ton of flavor and didn't need the additional topping a normal pho needs. I was so surprised. The truffle and caviar was just as interesting. They used zucchini noodles and tapioca for the caviar. The truffle flavor was definitely there.

Upon entering, the hostess told us that the many empty tables were all reserved. She sat us at a high shared bar table, which was fine. We ordered our drinks, a lemonade and a matcha latte with oat milk. My companion's lemonade was good, but a little hard to sip with all the stray pieces of rosemary. The latte was bitter, even with two packs of cane sugar, and full of matcha sludge at the bottom.

As an appetizer, we ordered jackfruit croquettes and were not provided sharing plates, forcing us to eat out of the same cumbersome bowl. The croquettes were fine, but the topping (""a corn salsa"" w/ random baby spinach) was difficult to consume.

My friend ordered the mushroom risotto; I had the chili. The risotto ""tasted like mushroom soup from a can, the peas were undercooked, the only visible ""mushroom"" tasted stale. It was awful."" I had the chili which was cold and utterly flavorless, without even a dash of salt, nor was any salt or pepper available on the table. The beans in the chili were undercooked. It was served with corn chips, which was kind of them, as they didn't give me a spoon.

Some of the other food looked and smelled really good, and perhaps we picked the wrong dishes or got unlucky, but overall this was a bad experience. 

Ambiance-wise, the decor was a bit hackneyed - Edison bulbs & weird hanging chairs. The music would have been appropriate for watching my father wash his Camaro in the summer of 1988 - e.g. ""Don't Fear The Reaper"".

The food was insanely overpriced. Two entrees of tasteless vegetarian slop, a passable appetizer, and two non-alcoholic drinks were $70!","1 star rating"

The first time I came by the burgers were good. I liked the tofu ban mi burger more than the veggie patty taste wise. My wife also wanted the onion rings and fries so we got them. The onion rings had little to no taste and were not salted much. For a fried food...I think they need to be salted. The sauce that came with the onion rings also had little to no taste.

We came back again a few days later as we are vegetarian. 

This time we got the lasagna and the pot pie and decided to give the onion rings another chance.

The lasagna had no noodles or at least felt like there were none. It seemed more like a tomato casserole than lasagna...we opted for the ricotta cheese on top for extra...I could only really taste tomato and the dish was under salted.

The pot pie came out and looked great. Then we tried it and the taste was just flat. No taste really at all. The jack fruit inside tasted like it was just dropped in the dish without any flavor added. We cook jack fruit at home from time to time and it's a great option to substitute for meat if flavored correctly. Unfortunately this felt like the jack fruit went straight from the can or jar and into the pot pie...no bueno.

The onion rings again were not salted and neither was the sauce that came with them. 

For the prices of the food here and the reviews Lov gets we expected a bit more. Especially since we know there's good vegan food to be had if done correctly. 

The staff was very nice and accommodating and even removed the dishes off our bill once we let them know. I'm writing this review in hopes they can improve as I think they can.","3 star rating"

The place is really cute and nicely decorated. I like the hanging chairs even though they pretty much serve no purpose. 

The service was very slow and the place was not packed. I waited maybe 15 minutes for my friends to arrive and the waiter did not offer me any water and did not ask if I wanted a drink in the meantime. It took awhile to get our food and the waiter brought one cocktail at a time. Also when the waiter saw that the water jug was empty he wasn't going to fill it up! I had to ask him to do so. 

I started with the Egyptian Karkade cocktail, which consisted of dark rum, saffron, hibiscus lemon and angostura bitters. It was not good. :( My friends tried my drink too and they all didn't like it either. I then had the Pina Koala mocktail and asked the waiter to put white rum in it. It resembled a pina colada and that drink was actually good. It was made up of coconut milk, pineapple, eucalyptus, kombucha and mint/chlorophyll. I then decided to stick to Beau's beer and play it safe.

We all had the poutine. The sauce is miso based. The poutine was good but I would have liked there to be more sauce. It was all at the bottom so the poutine was a dry on top and you couldn't mix it.

The bartender Jessica was super friendly and helped me with the menu (I only know a bit of French) She recommended the burger and I said yes. They also had healthy options like a carrot and ginger soup and a LOVely sounding beet salad but I had come from walking 10 miles around the city in the snow & cold and I knew only a burger would hit the spot.

The patty had a nice crispy texture on the outside with a soft interior. It held together between bites underneath the buttery bun. The bib lettuce thinly sliced onions pickles tomatoes & cheese made the burger taste fresh and somewhat healthy. I mean it could be super healthy but it was so delicious my tastebuds were not sure. The sweet and salty LOV sauce rounded out the flavors of the burger. I ate the entire thing by myself very happily and very quickly. 

My next favorite part of the night was the amazing PINK drink. Also know as the Castilian Paloma. Tantalizingly tart and slightly sweet. And so cool to look at. And so easy to drink.

This restaurant has great reviews on all the other review platforms. I was surprised to see such low reviews here. I personally recommend giving it a try. It's beautiful and fun and tasty.","5 star rating"

We were intrigued by the ""Local, Organic, Vegan"" concept, and thought this would be an excellent place to detox after a few greasy and carb-y meals in Montreal! As soon as we stepped foot in the interior of the restaurant, the atmosphere and decor nearly took my breath away - I thought I was transported to a rustic, but chic gourmet boutique cafe in Los Angeles or Paris! LOV during dinnertime is dimly lit, perfect for an intimate date night or a low-key birthday celebration at night. Although we didn't have reservations, we were lucky enough to score a two-person table in a relatively quiet nook of the restaurant. 

Service was so kind and attentive. One waiter seated us, and another introduced the menu to us. For a starter, we ordered a Pho to share. The Pho soup consists of lemongrass broth, bok choy, konjac noodle, fried tofu, bean sprouts, Thai basil, enoki mushrooms, and lime. It was so, so tasty and innovative - unlike any pho dish I have ever tried. As opposed to a massive, hulking bowl of pho, their pho is served in a dainty bowl with the ingredients arranged artfully on top. The konjac noodles were an interesting consistency, kind of bouncy but with good texture. The fried tofu was also well seasoned, and an excellent complement to the fresh veggies, like the crispy bok choy. The highlight of the pho soup was obviously the broth. The lemongrass flavor absolutely shines through, and was the perfect antidote to a freezing and snowy winter night! 

For entrees, I ordered the Power Bowl, which consists of mesclun / arugula, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, pickled radish, corn, carrot, quinoa, lentil, sprouted mung beans, a specialty LOV crunch mix and avocado / basil green goddess dressing. Simply put, this was probably one of the best, most colorful salads I've had in my life. So filling and delicious. All the different ingredients added a variety of textures in the salad, so it didn't feel like I was just eating a plate of greens. The pickled radish in particular added a wonderful tangy crunch to the mix. The LOV crunch mix consisted of sunflower seeds, raisins, and corn nuts - an unusual combo but very tasty when mixed in with the salad. My boyfriend ordered the Banh Mi burger, which he greatly enjoyed as well. He wished the sriracha aioli were a little spicier, but the concept of the restaurant is showcasing the flavor of the veggies and ingredients, as opposed to overpowering them with seasoning! 

My main takeaway is that I would absolutely come here again and would recommend LOV to anyone, vegan or otherwise. LOV knows just how to bring the freshness and essence of the vegetables to center stage. The ingredients are not hiding behind a veil of heavy seasoning or fried oil, but rather are enhanced by its other companions on the dish. Everything we tried was fresh, clean, delicious, and reasonably priced. Coupled with great service, LOV is a 5-star experience!","5 star rating"

In the late afternoon they only offer smaller plates so I've only tried the Hummus Toast. The nut cheese and olive crumbs on the pink beet hummus made a really tasty and also eye-catching combination. It's nothing you couldn't easily reproduce at home though, so I wouldn't go back just to have it again. The bread didn't seem too fresh, it was a little tough, and the slice also could have been a little thicker.
To treat myself, I also ordered their mocktail Pina Koala. Cute name, pretty decoration, and quite tasty.
I'd like to visit again and try something from the full menu to be able to give a better judgement.","4 star rating"

The food was delicious and full of flavour. For two people we ordered the poutine, the tempe bowl, the kale ""Caesar""and the squash dish. The meal was superb. Portions are on the smaller side so order multiple dishes.

The server and host were extremely friendly and polite. Definitely top-notch service that's passionate about the food and genuinely friendly.

As indicated by one of the reviews in French, the vibe is very trendy and LA-style and is a nice addition to the restaurant scene in Montreal. 

We ordered a class of Quebec sparkling bubbly and the portion of booze was VERY generous. The glass was filled up to the top which was much appreciated!

My only small critique was that the dessert potion was too small. We related this feedback to the server. It was more like ""cheesecake shavings"" as opposed to an actual piece of cheesecake. Would have gladly payed more for a bigger portion.

Overall, this is an excellent restaurant and I highly recommend it whether you're a vegetarian or a carnivore.","4 star rating"

My companions and I were extremely famished and were looking for a place that can satisfy our vegan needs. We were immediately greeted by a light feel in the air, one that reminds you of grandma's cooking, and following that sensory revelation was a kind waiter who gave us options as to our seating preferences, contrary to the behavior of many in the industry. At the table we were greeted by a simplistic and homey ambiance, one with a hint of elegance to exemplify that you've arrived at a place of class. And the classy qualities did not end with just appearances, the food followed up and satisfied. With a variety of options and each dish vying for the best on a list of many, my group and I were surprised and delighted by each subsequent plate, and constantly asking for seconds. The taste was amazing, although that does not truly do it justice. If I had to describe it properly, all I can say is this: you must try it yourself. Our favorite dish by far was the Poke bowl, which blended flavors of seaweed, wood mushrooms, and mango to entice my taste buds for another bite.

To add to the problem, there was one of those ""please get in touch with us to discuss your recent experience"" replies, which I responded to, but did not get a reply.  Note to management: if you reach out to a customer, you should reply to them if they take the time to get back to you.  All that to say I wanted to give this place another chance, but figured we'd try their other location in hopes of better service.  Alas no.  It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order.  The food did arrive in a reasonable amount of time but some of it (the soup, the onion rings and the quinoa fritters) were lukewarm.  We had to chase someone down for the cheque and our original server seemed surprised that we had paid and were leaving. 

The decor, as others have mentioned, is lovely, and the food is quite good.  We tried the soup of the day, the quinoa fritters, beet salad, big hero and the lov burger.  Everyone liked their food except my daughter who had the big hero and said it was ""weird"".  No other details were forthcoming.

I'd probably only come back here if I was eating with a vegan or vegetarian guest, because their menu is definitely a step up of those options from most other restaurants.  The slow and indifferent service would keep me away otherwise.","3 star rating"

The place is very Instagrammable. Very pretty, very calm, like a plantation, colonial set up (ignore all the terrible associations with that), with rattan white chairs and pretty lighting everywhere.

The food itself was just okay.

Took the quinoa croquettes and found them very flour-y. It was yummy but it left an aftertaste of flour.

The waitress sort of sighed and tried very hard to ignore us when we asked for another empty bowl to split the meal to share the two so we could try each other's bowls. One star off for that.

We took the ""classic LOV burger"" and it was okay. Tasted fine, but the black bean patty was not the best I have ever had (Copper Branch burgers are better)...  The sauce, the bread, it was all fine because it tasted like a burger with the sauce, but the patty was not very meat-y in flavour (I am not a vegan or vegetarian by the way).

The Thai curry was good, but needed far more rice and sauce, and it lacked a home-yness to it that I associate with curries and rice. It felt a little flat.

Portions were okay. With the appetizer and meal, it was okay, but I wasn't thinking: Wow I am full! .. which is fine, because it is never good to eat too much.

Still, my favourite place to eat vegan / vegetarian is Copper Branch","3 star rating"

Highly recommend the cheese plate and poutine there.

Cheese plate had a feta that was uncanny and a bleu cheese that was unlike any other vegan cheese I've ever had. Similar to Miyoko's, but the flavor profiles were more complex.

The closest subway is Square Victoria and it's a short walk from there. Street parking is available but mostly metered and it may be tough to find a spot on the weekend. 

The place: It's not incredibly big, but it's spacious enough. The decor is simple but lovely and cozy. Overall, the place has a great vibe. My date called a day or two in advanced to make a reservation for 7:45pm.

The goods: We ordered a few dishes to share because we wanted to taste a variety of things. My date ordered the soup - it was a velouté containing eggplant and carrot (I think). The flavor was nice, but there was something missing. My date thought it was salt and I thought it should be a little spicier. The quinoa fritters and curry dish were both big hits - absolutely delicious! The avocado toast was nice, but it fell short on seasoning (as in, there was none). I'm still not sure how I feel about the brussel sprouts - from a flavor perspective, they were OK, but the leaves were so very crispy that they fell apart pretty quickly and it was like eating air. The gnocchi that everyone raves about were a complete miss for us. We both found the dish to be very, very dry and lacking in flavor. Between us, I think that we ate half - maybe. We ordered a bottle of Riesling and really enjoyed that. Skipped dessert.

Service: Good. Our waitress was really nice and friendly.

The service is atrocious. Hands down the most appalling experience I have had in 15 years. Though the reservation was made a month in advance, we were bumped by 45m upon arrival. No apology. 

When seated, it took 20m to order even a drink. My main course arrived 15 minutes after the first, after I asked the waitress to check on it. When it arrived, it was clearly rushed and undercooked. One party at our table had two long black hairs in her risotto. 
In order to pay, two of us had to get up to ask the waitress for the check, and it took over 30m from when we finished. We missed our show in the old port. She brought the bills, and I had to get up after we had them for ten minutes to allow us to actually pay.

Luckily we were only two and we got one of their ""swing"" table. You basically sit on a swing chair (it's attach on the ceiling) and you have a little table. The waitress apologized since there was no other table but it was actually quiet lovely.
Food: 
I ordered their truffle and caviar with a poached egg. It's a zucchini spaghetti with a type of fungus called pleurote and tapioca caviar (ha) in a truffle sauce. It had a unique taste; I didn't really like it, I didn't like the after taste. My girlfriend loved it.
She ordered the pok'ai: a type of salad with watermelon, cucumber, avocados, and edamame in a type of ginger sauce. I loved her dish. So we switched dishes.

We came here for dinner on a weeknight and I was pretty floored at the gorgeousness of the decor here - it's so beautifully decorated/furnished that it makes you want to instantly eat here (read: IG-worthy place!) We ordered the soup, jack fruit fritters, and LOV poutine to start (the fritters were delicious!). We then had the risotto, pesto gnocchi, and coconut curry as our mains. Every dish was artfully presented and delicious. The gnocchi and curry surpassed the risotto but all the dishes were yummy.

Even though I have eaten here several times with our tiny dog, at times in the puppy bag that we use for airplanes, this time they refused us entry to the outdoor terrace on the street.

The manager lied that they don't have the permits to allow small dogs.

Guess what, you do not require a permit!

So we are enjoying food next door at a very doggie friendly terrace named ""Marche des Eclusiers"" with even more awesome food, best sangria ever on the river.

Call to all dog lovers, Lov does not love puppies!!!

Based on reviews only, I decided to check out Restaurant LOV to see what it was like. I had such a great experience! They have great tasting and good looking mocktails and the food is incredible. My recommendations: the asparagus special appetizer (so good!), truffle & caviar (ask for a spoon to not miss a drop of the sauce), the pok' ai' (the watermelon preparation is so unique!), the beet tartar (so so tasty!).

When I discovered an upscale vegetarian spot is opening in Montreal, I was beyond excited. We have a lot of decent vegetarian spots, but LOV is dubbed as the one with a creative twist. 

Good: Conveniently located in the Old Port right by Square Victoria, this seems like the perfect spot for locals and tourists. The interior decor is beautiful, trendy, and totally Instagram worthy. I was excited just entering the restaurant. Lots of greenery, exposed white brick walls, and just simply gorgeous decor. As for the food, the best thing I've had here was the kale Mac & cheese. Even my boyfriend was surprise that 'it's not real cheese?'. Service was very good, the waiters were attentive and courteous. 

Bad: they don't have an English menu, which was a bit surprising considering it's in such a touristy area. I understand some French, but still had to ask the waiter to explain some of the dishes. I really wanted to love this place, but I honest felt the food was mediocre and menu description sounds better than the actual meal (except that Kale Mac and cheese was 10/10). I've ordered the 'Hero', (note: the staff was accommodating when it came to my sesame allergies, big ups!) The dish came in a beautiful bowl, nice presentation, but tasted horribly bland. Few pieces of unseasoned steamed eggplants were buried in the middle. The napa cabbage was minimally flavoured and kind of soggy. The tempeh was okay. Very small portion, but that was fine because the Mac and cheese was very filling anyways. Basically, the Hero was more of a Zero.

My boyfriend ordered the Rave, which was celery root. Beautiful looking dish, however the only part that was good was the guacamole and pickled onions (I think). The grains were pretty flavourless so I didn't really enjoy it either. I think I did more of a Rant than a Rave.

We also had a brownie for dessert at the end, which was okay. The almonds were a bit over roasted and the brownie was really hard. *sigh*

The food taste like something from a culinary school, beautiful presentations, but the flavours and skills are not all there yet (except that kale Mac and Cheese).

Bottom line: I probably wouldn't go back by choice. If my girlfriends want to try it, I might give it a shot again just to order the kale Mac and cheese.","2 star rating"

The place definitely gets 5/5 for decor and ambience - tall ceilings, beautiful white washed brick walls and lush potted plants tastefully placed gives the space an airy bohemian vibe. Service was good, prices were acceptable...oh, and the waiters are all tall attractive men. 

In terms of the food, we shared the kimchi fries, which were fantastic, with complex flavours and a great fermented cabbage kick. However, the Chili de lupeh off the seasonal menu was quite average, and somewhat small in size. The flavour of the chili itself was fine, but so is the chili from Tim Hortons. After a surprising and innovative appetizer, this was a sad $14 disappointment. 

I would certainly try this place again because I suspect there are stronger menu items. However, I will be judicious in what I order.","3 star rating"

Yesterday we walked in. They said they were closed, or something, even though people were eating. We weren't gonna argue, so we made a reservation for tonight.

Tonight, we arrived and were shown our  ""table,"" which was bar-style, not very wide, and too high. It wasn't really a table. More like a Tim Horton's window counter, except Lov's is an island for people to face each other. 

Other tables were available but the one we wanted was reserved. I got the feeling our reservation didn't carry the same weight as other reservations . So we left.

Maybe it's because of their excellent social media presence, or just because they hit all the right points, it's as simple as that. They nail it.

- The decor is what strikes you first of course. It's light, playful, refreshing; elaborate and curated but not taking itself seriously, like the food.
- The food is on point. It's not a vegan restaurant that hides its preference, or a baba cool hippie from the 60's with only grain dishes. Each dish has it's own flavor and texture; inventive, satisfying, good proportions and careful presentation. May be the dessert was the disappointment (hence the lost star) as it was not up to par with the rest of the meal. Don't tell your carnivore friends it's vegan, and they will still be satisfied.
- The service was nice and easy. They may be trendy and full, but they still have a smile each time they interact, and they take their time with you. You don't feel rushed and the service is friendly without being unprofessional.

A very rounded experience - the price is right, for a well delivered and executed experience. It's an experience that makes you smile and be happy, like the decor.","4 star rating"

Would recommend les croquette de quinoa. Found the Poutine a bit salty. Was not overly impressed by the Chou fleur entrée. In general their plates are not large, so you will have to order a good amount of food.

Their desserts are constantly rotating, but we got the cheesecake and really enjoyed it! 

Excellent ambiance, not overly packed, even though it seems to be challenging to get a reservation here. Relatively quick food service","4 star rating"

The restaurant itself is beautiful and has an amazing ambiance, but unfortunately, the food is horrible! 

I opted for the eggplant appetizer - there were nice flavors, but I couldn't get over the fact that it was just large, soggy, cold pieces of eggplant in a soup. My friend got the kale mac & cheese, which our waitress told us was mindblowing but really had no flavor and just tasted like plain pasta in mashed squash - definitely ""not worth the calories"", as she said. 

Next, for the entree, I got the summer garden salad and my friend ordered the Caesar salad. Both were absolute letdowns! They were both just huge portions of greens with a very acidic yet flavorless dressing - the only difference between them was the small sprinkling of toppings on each. Mine had some fruit and hers had tomatoes, dry & plain croutons, grated almonds instead of parmesan, and capers which have no place in a Caesar salad! 

Maybe we ordered the wrong food, but we left the restaurant with disappointment and stomach aches (from the huge acidic salads). Our meal cost us $70 - I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this.","1 star rating"

Incredible. Great food and atmosphere. One of the best Vegan or Vegetarian restaurants I have ever been too, period. Lots of creative items to choose from. I hade the Mushroom Carpaccio to start - better than the real thing. Gnocchi for main course - excellent preparation and flavors. 

Glutenberg gluten free IPA in a can - surprisingly satisfying. I would make it my go to beer if I could find it back in Michigan. Attention Michigan craft brewers - consider tapping into the gluten free market. (Pun intended)

I gave it 4 stars but it's really 5. I don't want to give the impression that I just give out 5 stars to everything I like. However, if I come back and have a similar experience I am sure lov can earn 5 stars  - no problem.

I didn't see how the drink was made but it certainly didn't taste like there was any shaking or effort needed to make that drink. I could have mixed my own tequila w abit of pamplemouse juice at home. So many more better cocktail bars in Montréal so they certainly need to buckle up if one is charging $11 for such quality. 

Too much hype about this place. It was probably one of those ""to-be-seen"" spots in Montréal.

We discovered it last summer and were impressed with our 1st visit. Our experience this time couldn't have been more different.

We had a reservation, showed up a few minutes early, were seated immediately. Our waiter took our order, brought our drinks, and then we waited for our food. And waited. And waited.

We realized that people seated after us were getting their food. A couple seated at the table next to us had ordered the same appetizer as we had. We ordered ours well before they did, and they received their appetizer and meal before we had even received our appetizer. 

After 45 minutes of waiting, we requested our waiter to check on our order, and he ignored this request. The waiter only took action once he saw how unhappy we were becoming.
The food, when it finally arrived, was disappointing: lukewarm temperature, the gnocchi was hard and chewy (unlike on our 1st visit), and generally not up to the level expected for this price point. But we were out of time to send it back as we had an appointment to keep.

We won't be going back.","1 star rating"

We shared the beet tartare and it was so good with so many layers of flavor with the mint and cashew cream and dusted seaweed - it really felt like eating raw fish. I had the hero 2.0 with egg noodles, eggplant, broccoli, tempeh, bok choy and kimchi. The dish was sweet, tangy and spicy but I couldn't eat the kimchi (I don't think they've gotten their kimchi quite right).

After a 7 hour drive to Montréal, we just wanted something to eat close to our hotel. My husband isn't vegan but is usually up for plant based dining as long as it's not boring. LOV was anything but boring. It was quite busy with just a few seats open on a Monday night at 9:00PM. We were warmly welcomed by the host and shown to a table right away. Our waiter, Marius was delightful, funny and super attentive. We started with kombucha mojitos and they were definitely the perfect choice. I only want kombucha based cocktails from now on. Next we shared the vegan poutine which was absolutely delicious. The vegan cheese cubes are almond based and the mushroom gravy was thick and creamy. I couldn't wait to try the french onion soup. It did not disappoint. I have been craving french onion soup since I went vegan over a year ago. It was warm and comforting, perfect for warming up on such a chilly night. My husband enjoyed his tofu banh mi burger. In fact he enjoyed it so much I didn't even get to try it. I'll take his word for it. We were too tired for dessert but returned the following night to try the Big LOV Burger, onion rings, dumplings, Pho. Everything was incredible. Seriously.

Walking into this restaurant in the morning is like a breath of fresh air. The decor is beautiful and the space is bright. The service was friendly and we got great recommendations.  I love that the drinks come with your choice of milk alternative, be it soy, almond milk etc. I thought the menu choices were rather limited but I was happy with my meal choice.

I had the coureur des bois: a spicy, but flavorful brunch item.  Don't order it if you can't handle spicy food.  The smoothie bowls that my friends ordered looked beautiful, but I can't justify paying $9 for a smoothie that was poured into a bowl and then topped with a few goji berries and oatmeal.

I had to book online almost two weeks in advance to get a reservation for a weekend evening, so I had pretty high hopes. The restaurant's decor is nice, but it's a bit over crowded. Many of the tables are almost squashed together, so you could end up eating elbow to elbow with strangers. 

In terms of the food, it was.. ok. I tried the Lov burger which was tasty but not exceptional. The patty was soft and fell apart easily, but the flavour was good. I also tried the fries, which were pretty generic. The house ketchup was more like salsa - thick and chunky - and was not what I would choose to eat fries with. My friend had the buckwheat sweet potato gnocchi with pesto which was also pretty good, but not great. The gnocchi was extremely dense and heavy and the pesto was a bit overpowering, although the use of arugula added a nice bitterness to the dish. I think what irked me the most was that the portion sizes were quite small for the price. The burger, for instance, didn't come with anything, not even a side salad. All to say, if I had known, I would have ordered more appetizers. 

All in all, I think Lov is fine, but nothing to write home about. For the amount I ended up spending after dinner and drinks, I didn't leave feeling very satisfied. Unless someone gives me a recommendation for a particular dish that is above average, I probably won't be back.","3 star rating"

The first time I went, having made a reservation online, we still had to wait 30 minutes for a table. We felt rushed because the kitchen was closing and ended up cutting our evening short. 

I decided to give it a second chance. I went today for lunch and lo and behold, their computer system went down just after we were seated. I should also mention that the seating process was disorganized and people who walked in after us were seated before us. We had to remind the manager we were waiting. Anyway, because the system was down, were told by our server that we could not order and would just have to wait for an undetermined amount of time. I totally understand that these things can happen but maybe have a contingency plan in place? We waited for 15 minutes and then ended up leaving.

Throughout the night multiple staff apologized for where we were sitting but it was sweet and farther away from the noise. 

The service was amazing, and we were shocked to learn they had just opened 5 weeks ago as the place was absolutely packed. The waiters and also who I assume was the manager were very busy running around and kept checking to make sure everything was ok. The staff were sweet and helpful. I'm sure as it is a new place they are eager to work out any kinks. 

The place is beautifully decorated, and the ambiance is that of a lively restaurant. A bit loud, but then again it was packed. The food was delicious, the gnocci was fresh tasting and warm, the entrees were rather large and interesting. The two other dishes were the roast beets and something I've forgotten the name of, but was tempeh and eggplant of some sort. Both received thumbs ups. 

Affordable, delicious and a lovely atmosphere!","5 star rating"

They called to confirm everything an hour before our arrival, asking if we'd be willing to push our reservation to 8pm instead due to too many guests (strike 1). We were already on our way so we couldn't allow it. 

Upon entering the restaurant, you're greeted with a slim, vertical high table enough for 10 people just inches away from the entrance. The hostess only spoke to us in french despite speaking to her in english, and she immediately directed us to the seats right by the entrance. My friends and I didn't like this so we asked for one of the open tables further down near the kitchen. She, on the other hand, argued that since it's busy, we would have to stick with the seats we were given since we made no table specifications on our reservation online (strike 2). We didn't know this seeing as it was a new restaurant and there was no indication of different seat types online. Despite this, we persisted and were eventually redirected to a new table. The hostess treated us coldly and remained tense toward us for the entirety of our night.

Since we got there at a busy hour, the drinks took 20 mins to arrive alongside our appetizers, and our food took another 40mins. We were getting anxious to try out our food only for our meals to fall short of our expectations. Even when we sat right in front of the kitchen, our food was hard and cold, and just as bland (strike 3). Only good thing out of it was the kale mac n cheese. 

The decor was gorgeous but as we started to pay attention to our surroundings, we thought it was a little too try-hard on the hipster side. From the bearded and tattooed servers, to the bicycle-mounted sinks, the white open-brick walls, and organic lavender-scented soaps, the aura of pretentiousness started to get to us. That being said, you pay for the experience and the atmosphere, so I'll give them that. 

All in all, our experience was a solid 3/10. We tried to like it, but the cold/overpriced meals, the rude hostess, the fussy reservation, and the general vibe of this place left us not wanting to come back. Sorry, Lov.","2 star rating"

I went to LOV the first time and had a vegan burger which was pretty tasty. We also ordered the mac and cheese which was decent but too salty and a cesar salad that tasted like nail polish (something we decided after many minutes of trying to see what was off about it). My second time however was such a disappointment. I ordered the Poutine that was drenched in so much sauce that it was basically a soup and was salty to the point of being inedible. My friends all ordered the gnocchis which were gummy, bland and all thought the pesto had a weird after taste. I ordered the celery rave which was just ok. The cheesecake and the burger were the only things Ive ordered that I thought were really good and worth it. 

Overall I think LOV is popular for its instagramable decor and plating but falls short in terms of taste and quality. Go there for the drinks and cheese cakes but you'd be better off at other vegan places in Montreal.","2 star rating"

Two long time vegan travellers visited for the first time yesterday for Saturday brunch. The decor while nice, can best be described as ""pintresty"". High ceilings and hallway-like space makes it a bit loud. I had the vegan Big LOV burger, she had the vegan Haskap Berry Grilled Cheese, and we shared a side of potatoes. 

The first bite of the burger gave an immediately reaction that I had that taste before. Then I realized the name and recognized the taste as a Big Mac, pretty spot on! I cannot say that I missed that taste, but I can't say that it was bad - just wasn't ""wowed"". The taste was more from the sauce and mix of pickle/toppings than the burger. In fact, having a bite of the burger alone without the bread or anything else on it was surprisingly bland. It tasted like what it was - black beans.

The Grilled Cheese was pretty darn good though, for a grilled cheese! If you are looking for something different I would recommend that over the burger.

The potatoes were perhaps the best! It was a take on poutine with a vegan cheese sauce and a maple/sriracha syrup. There was enough syrup to dip the burger in and give it a bit more of a zip!

Service was OK/neutral. The food came out fairly quickly even though the restaurant was nearly full, but we waited a bit after we finished and ended up having to ask for our check.

I think LOV benefits most from its location near McGill. I would consider the menu to be very well done veganized college fare. Indeed most of the crowd seemed college folks either in groups or seemingly with their parents.","3 star rating"

I am by no means vegan and was hesitant to spend a precious dinner meal at anywhere other than a gluttonous, French restaurant while in Montreal this past weekend. My friend and I came across LOV on a walk and were drawn in by its dreamy decor. I ruled it out for an option to visit later that night because it was vegan but was convinced by my friend...best decision ever! Honestly if no one told me all the dishes were made vegan I would have never guessed. The decor, cocktails, mains and dessert were to die for - and I felt that much better afterwards knowing I had eaten something slightly better for me than I usually would.

Very good mix between imitation of non vegan meals and truly unique creations so your non vegan friends still feel comfortable and you can have have something new and exciting. I naturally got one of each, the kale mac and cheese and what was called rebel. The mac and cheese was delightful. The kale added some freshness to a very light cashew cheese sauce, very good balance. Rebel is what blew me away. It was a perfect symphony of flavors.

I was looking forward to it because we were in great spirits and excited to enjoy a nice rare dinner together. Unfortunately, our reservation was pushed unbeknownst to us -- they called 45 minutes before the 6 pm reservation and with no answer, still decided to push it. Beyond that this is just an odd thing to do, there was no offer to get us drinks in the meantime or even an apology or visit from the manager when we came back to sit down. Our server was friendly, but it was clear she was way too busy and had tables across the entire restaurant so she was running around. I blame this on management because a server should never be overloaded where service is delayed to this extent. As people who do or have worked in the service industry, it was just overall a disappointing experience, extra disappointing when you're on vacation and taking guests from out of town. A glass was broken and never fully cleaned up. We waited a very long time for our check, even after requesting it. That was the only time we really spoke up to the staff (after 15-20 minutes of dirty plates in front of us), other than communicating our frustration when first arriving for our reservation, so I guess it's on us for not speaking up more, but it's just unfortunate we weren't followed up with by a manager after the delayed reservation. And the food was good, but definitely nothing to write home about. I think the onion rings and the grilled cheese were some of the stand out dishes within the group. I will say that the space is beautiful as others mentioned, the ambience and decor is appealing (which is why I'll do 2 stars and not 1 for the degree it ruined the group's mood), but I'd only recommend it to a group of 2-4, not 6, like in our case. We were seated in the front of the restaurant, which doesn't have the same atmosphere as the rest of the restaurant, and perhaps why we were generally ignored.","2 star rating"

The presentation was ridiculous just a cherry tomato on top, looked really cheap. A little salad or a small side on the plate would make it more appealing. The burger was dense, very heavy nothing I would expect when I'm going to a vegan place. Almost felt like there was filler in my burger, I felt ""off"" the next morning. The mac n cheese was ok but the kale in it made it have a weird aftertaste. Even the wine by the glass selection was off. Although the decor is lovely, the menu and kitchen definitely need more work.

Waited over an hour for appetizers which didn't even come first, but last and in my friends case never. Lack of proper airflow in the restaurant makes this place terrible for the summer, no AC either. Food portions are for old ladies who are overly sensitive to their weight and the costs dont match up(i.e. 18$ for a quarter plate of mushrooms.)

Place is very beautifully designed, similar clean white aesthetic like mandy's or crudessence, and the commitment to visual detail is really remarkable - makes you feel like you're walking in a kinfolk magazine. Only complain about the floor layout is that there's is one table that is stark in front of the door, unfortunately in montreal no guest would appreciate to sit there during the winter. Caters to all diets - vegans rejoice, the menu is not limited to your standard tofu/tempeh/cashew cheese items and is quite inventive with their flavours, taste wise the dishes are excellent. To the kitchen team however, it took our food almost half an hour to reach our table, and my friend's meal was so cold she could barely eat but didn't complain at the risk of waiting another half an hour for the meal to be remade. White walls and ambient lighting aside, the restaurant is definitely classy enough to belong in the old montreal food scene but i think some small details still need fine tuning. People who dine here must also have only been speaking exclusively in french, as despite speaking to the hostess in english and showing struggling speaking in french she still only addressed to us in that language.","3 star rating"

They only have one menu that is for brunch & lunch on Saturdays, with a limited selection but still some interesting things to choose from. We tried out their non-alcholic cocktail which was delicious  ($7 each). I had their famous vegan LOV burger that came with some crudites I think. It was delicious. I was hoping to have the kimchi fries but they are not available for brunch/lunch, only for dinner. I think my friend had the lumberjack which she found delicious and filling. I on the other hand was still hungry after my burger, that would be my only issue with this restaurant. We spent $40 total for a very simple but delicious lunch yet I was still hungry.

The prices are relatively high compared to other restaurant. The food quality is good but you can get better in other restaurants for a lower price. Expect to pay 20$ minimum per person.

I ordered beef and it was tasty and super tender. My dad took General Tao chicken and it was also very good. Actually, we decided to take the combo menu. It cost 40$ for 2 persons and you get a huge portion of rice, 2 entries, 2 soups and 2 main dishes. We finished it all, but I have to say that we were super hungry, so maybe that you'll have too much of it, but you can take the remains at home. The Singapour style noodles is the best thing over there and maybe the best noodles in Lachine-Dorval.

And they deliver.","4 star rating"

The whole transaction was smooth.  It only took 30 minutes from order online to arrival.  Since I have the interview the next morning, I ordered the basics:  fried rice and steam veggie.  The steam veggie is not on the online menu, so I just type in the comment and they get what I want.  The online menu just say seasoned veggie so I am in for a surprise.  Boy I was surprised!  They put in the extra sweet say sauce (the good one for fish) in a container and no normal human can take just boiled tasteless veggies ( unless you have been eating fake Chinese food for years and a small town in the southern states like me).  That is nice.

Problem were: the soy sauce flipped and spill all over.  Also the mere were no utensils.  Since I were in the hotel I resort to eat with the coffee stirrers.

Despite the great effort spent to clean up and eat, the food taste great!  It is comparable to any Asian restaurants on big cities like Hong Kong or Toronto.

Highly recommend anyone visiting Montreal to try their food.","4 star rating"

I was invited last minute for lunch at this upstairs and non-descript Cantonese restaurant. I'll throw in 'old school' for good measure, because it had many round white cloth covered tables spread across a one room dining area with the cash right by the entrance to the stairwell, and then add a ceramic pot of Chinese tea to the visual.

Now for the tasty part; the laminated full-page of lunch specials that runs from 11:30am to 3:30pm (I believe weekdays for $9 even before taxes and service). Most of the dishes looked interesting, but I went with the (semi) spicy salt & pepper; lightly battered and fried pork chops with diced onions and green peppers (I revisited the tastes and recall garlic as well), a pile of steamed white rice on the side, over baby Bok Choy. It was well and highly recommended size wise left enough for a lighter snack later on.

More yummy news, all the meals are served with either Won Ton soup (with shrimp filled won tons) or hot and sour which I opted for and was up there with the better I've had; not too goopy and even keel flavor.

Each gets one spring roll which was on the moister less crunchy side but substantial enough, and the standout of the lunch was the mini squirt bottle of orangy-yellow dipping sauce which tasted like liquefied Marmalade; very citrusy and memorable as far as sauces go.

In sum, a solid lunch find and easy to tell why many are repeat diners.","4 star rating"

We were choosing between the Lanzhou hand pulled noodles around the corner and this shop, and I do regret that we ultimately selected Keung Kee.

Since the prices are quite steep, we opted for the set meals. The soup came out first, and the clear broth with the essence of the fatty pork meat and bone really hit the spot. The other dishes eventually came out one by one, and we were also given a huge portion of rice served in a bowl on the side.

Salted Chicken (steamed):
This chicken was okay. It wasn't particularly smooth not moist; on the contrary, I found it slightly dry but also oily at the same time. Some parts were undoubtedly better marinated than the others, as I had a couple pieces practically unseasoned.

Stir Fried Beef and Bok Choy:
This was the only vegetable dish of the night, and it was pitiful. The entire thing was doused in oil and unbelievably greasy. It was evident that they used a lot of oil and cornstarch to make the sauce , and just poured the mess over some bok choy pieces.

Sweet and Sour Pork:
This was also very bad. The pieces of pork were heavily drenched in a thick batter, so every piece and bite was essentially 80% flour. I also tried two pieces of pineapple, and had to spit it out each time. There was a strong stench associated with it, and it was evident that the fruit simply just wasn't fresh.

Steamed Fish with Ginger and Scallions:
This dish was a bit more palatable, with five large filets of halibut fish steamed. I still did find it on the oily side, but it was the best dish of the night.

I vow to never come again.","2 star rating"

Luckily one of us  is originally from Beijing and knew this restaurant well so recommended it to us. ..kind of reluctantly because it was his favourite and likely because it was genuinely Chinese and not ""Canadian Chjnese""  that would otherwise appeal to a Québécois pallet. Hum.. I'm so glad I know him lol!

This place turned out to be great. In the end 3 other friends joined making it 8 of us. 4 including me shared different plates. One is fussy and only likes chicken and the other three who came late only ordered starters. The service varied. My Chinese friend ordered for us in Chinese.. the waitress was friendly and helpful speaking a little English to the rest of us. We were a mix of English, French and Chinese. The waiter though who also served us was a bit surly and seemed annoyed at our three late guests and he having to take any additional orders. He wasn't so good. Oh, just note they forgot one our dishes in the end but apparently we didn't notice until after we finished as we were enjoying everything else. 

The decor.. large room on second floor.. other that giant menu options in Chinese on the wall there wasn't anything special about it. Albeit we were in Chinatown but were among the few non Asians in the room so a good sign the food is authentic. We happen to be seated at a giant round table which made it harder if not impossible to talk to people on the other side although again we were the exception as most others were at traditional tables. 

Now the food.. pretty awesome. My Beijing friend of corse ordered for us with nice compromising choices. It's hard to get 4 people to agree on everything. A nice pork broth soup came as the soup of the day. The meat and bone remained in the large serving bowl from which the waitress dished out into small bowls for us, was a perfect start. Pork, shrimp and chicken were among our groups main choices. The shrimp and snow peas were delicious. Shells were removed and I rediscovered snow peas all over again. The pork chops were breaded and greasy and tasty. Most came without the bone. My chicken loving friend ordered lemon chicken and a General Tao (which I always thought was a North American creation) both of which were tasty too. We had salty fish rice with it that which was surprisingly delicious. The veggies plate we ordered was forgotten. 

So, I'd recommend this restaurant. All of us liked everything we ate. In the end among us 4 our bill came to $28 each. I didn't have a drink and I can't recall now if the others did.. I'm going to say they didn't. Desert was a standard Chinese fortune cookie and Green tea was available all throughout the meal... apparently according to my fortune someone among us finds me cute lol.

We had reserved in advance, but it was unnecessary since it wasn't busy at all. 

Pros: 
- Very good food. It reminded me of my family's home cooking and it was very comforting after a long time without classic Chinese food. 
- the tea was refilled frequently
- They bring out oranges and fortune cookies at the end. It's nothing crazy, but I'm always happy when I get fortune cookies. 
- A lot of items on the menu (see cons) 
- Food came quickly

Cons: 
- Service wasn't particularly friendly, but it was okay
- The decor isn't great
- On the second floor, so not accessible by wheelchair (I think) 
- There are so many items that it can be really overwhelming for people if you have no idea what you're doing.

TL;DR I think the quality of the food greatly outweigh the ok service, but if you've never had Chinese food before, do some prep and know what you want!","4 star rating"

This eatery is everything that you'd expect from a Chinese place with tight seating, loud chattering, less than pleasant service and plastic lined table cloths with a man serving the food with his sweaty white t-shirt rolled up at the sleeves and looked as though he was either the dishwasher or prep cook.   He did a great job bringing the food out and was courteous but I think they should at least get him a collared polo shirt if he is going to be out serving food to the patrons.  The three dishes we ordered was bland and comparable to a fast food Chinese joint.  We had the Chinese broccoli which was good but that would really be hard to mess up.  The other two dishes were braised tofu and orange peel beef.  The tofu was very dry and did not have enough sauce.  The orange beef was a clump of fried beef sauteed in some sweet and sour sauce.
The only saving grace was that the $50 CAD price was only about $37 USD.
Why did I get Chinese food in Montreal?  Cause it was 8pm and getting late!  SORRY FOLKS..but I guess I'm more accustomed to better Chinese cuisine even on an island like Hawaii.","2 star rating"

We had reservation at 4:30pm. My friend arrived at 4:45. We were told we better to order dishes before 5pm or the chef will have dinner and the dishes will come out 30 mins late than average. We need time to read menu and than finalize order at 5:06 pm. The lady gave us some attitude, making us feel we uncomfortable. We tried our best to decide the order fast, and we didn't rush them or ask the chef not taking his break. Why they doing so?

The dishes were ok. Complimentary soup and orange. We had a pot of lamb, deep fried oyster, fried long bean and pork. I saw many people order the pot. It came with some vegetable after you finished the meat you can boil the vegetable. This one was 28$, but taste good. The other dishes were not as good as other places I usually go, probably because the taste was too mild. 

I bet their seafood is very good and reasonably priced. However, for my usual dinner routine, I prefer some other places in Chinatown.","3 star rating"

It's right in the heart of Chinatown and when we got there, it was packed with locals rather than tourists.  The classic Canto fare was pretty good (snow pea shoots, crispy chicken, fish maw soup) but the westernized fare was not so great (tomato shrimp, fried rice, etc.).

It's not exactly a hole in the wall place, since it has nice-ish decor (good for a sit down dinner), but the service is definitely very HK i.e. servers are kinda curt and food is plopped onto the table unceremoniously. Nothing appalling, just typical of service back home where efficiency is everything. It's worth it for the food though! Very authentic and surprisingly good, especially for the one seafood item we tried. There are seafood specials listed on signs around the dining area, mostly all in Chinese, but worth a try. Besides that, they also have lunch specials (11:30a-3p I think) that are a pretty good deal for around CAD5-8 per dish if you're looking for a quick lunch).

We got:
// oysters in garlic // 
REALLY good! Oysters are huge and tender, and the soy sauce / garlic hybrid that the oyster is cooked in is delicious (I poured the sauce onto some fried rice and devoured it). Seems like seafood is pretty decent here! 

// vegetables (tong choi) stir fried in fermented tofu //
Miss these vegetables dearly - portions are generous and it is prepared in the typical way, with the leafy bits soaking up the sauce and the thin stalks providing a bit of a crunch. The fermented tofu is salty and delicious, but may be an adventurous choice if you're not used to it.

// wonton noodles // 
I am quite picky about wonton noodles, but this is pretty solid. Noodles could have just a tiny bit more bite to it but the wonton itself is pretty good.

// crispy noodles with meat //
It has the crispy noodle base, and the tender noodles soaking up the sauce on the top part. 

// salted fish fried rice //
Definitely pungent (without being stinky), but that's the way I like it - again very authentic and might not be for everybody, but it is pretty good.","4 star rating"

Some of their specialties are the duck stew, deep fried seafood and deep fried milk sticks. 
I don't know any other restaurant that makes deep fried milk sticks in Montreal, so I was super grateful that they make it. They are very tasty! Crispy on the outside, soft, tender and sweet in the inside. They are kind of like deep fried ice cream but better.

For the last 12 years I've lived in USA and can't find Chinese restaurants on par with those I've frequented in Singapore until I came to Montreal's Chinatown and Keung Kee! The steamed fish was done to perfection and also our favorite razor clam and Chinese broccoli. 

We were so happy with lunch that we reserved a table for dinner the same day and it was fortunate that we did because it was packed on a Friday. For dinner we had Beijing Duck.

I heard many of the chefs are from Hong Kong hence they know the original recipes in making tasty Cantonese dishes. It could be very busy at times so plan ahead or make a reservation to avoid disappointment in waiting in line.

They also cook home made desserts and after a big meal, if your stomach still have room - make sure you ask for the soup based Chinese desserts such as red bean soup or coconut saggo which is very yummy.

At 5 pm, the staff was still in the middle of the family meal but they welcomed and sat us quickly. The restaurant featured disposable plastic tablecloths, mismatched chairs (some of them were folding) and tight spaces. Despite this, there was a line of guests that snaked down the stairs as guests settled in for a wait.

We selected a number of dishes, which when served family style, highlighted our love of sweet and sour flavor combinations. We gorged ourselves on crunchy stir-fried shrimp and chopped onions in tomato sauce; tender, crispy fried pork with onions and peppers in a sweet and sour sauce (my fave); fried shrimp and chicken with mayonnaise; savory crispy-skin duck with a sweet hoisin sauce, and a slightly spicy General Tso's chicken. A complimentary pork/black bean broth-based soup was served at the start of the meal, and similar to many other Chinese restaurants, orange wedges were served at the end.

It's really affordable betweek 10-14 $ for a plate.

And usually in this kind of restaurant everybody order a various meals and every body taste every plate. 

And the shrimps, beef and squid plates were excellent ! I liked them all !

We were 10 and on saturday they found us a big table easily so it's a plus !

The only thumb down is that the servers have a neutral face anytime, but as the service is fast and i only worry about the food it's ok. Also they don't speak french and just bit of english anyway just show them the menu and it's ok !   

Si vous voulez un repas chinois authentique ( style Hong kong) et que vous ëtes tannés des buffet Americano-chinois ! C'est un excellent endroit ou manger à Montréal.

C'est très abordable vous pouvez compter entre 10 et 14$ par plat. 

Habituellement  dans ce genre de restaurant tous le monde commande un plat différent, et on partage tous les plats afin que tous puissent goûter à la variétés de plats offert !

Nous étions un groupe de 10 un samedi soir, et ils nous ont trouvés une grande table facilement ce qui est très bien !

La seul point négatif est que les serveurs ne parlent pas français ( juste à leur montrer le menu !), et juste un peu l'anglais. 

Ils ont aussi un visage neutre à chaque fois qu'il vous servent. Vu que la qualité de la nourriture et la vitesse du service est ce qui m'importait vraiment c'était correct dans l'ensemble.

À essayer !","4 star rating"

 After calling the restaurant to order for delivery, I was assured I could pay cash if I ordered through just-eat.com.  This was incorrect and after making a profile and ordering I was forced to pay by credit card, after calling again and being told it was the only way to order delivery.  

Upon receiving our meal, we were given only 3 out of 6 items paid for.  After multiple calls we were told that they would rectify their mistake and send the rest of our food.  After an hour and a half the food hadn't arrived and upon calling again we were hung up on by rude and dismissive staff.  They were hugely disrespectful.   Eventually they promised to refund us the money if the food didn't arrive within an additional half hour.  Obviously we received nothing after 45 minutes and called back.  They then refused to refund us our payment.

The salt and pepper pork is amazing, don't hesitate about it. Nice choice is the salt and pepper toffu, which deserves to  be on the table along with the steamed green beans. Note I would not call the last two dishes vegetarian although they may sound like. We are still in search of the best fried rice in Montreal, meaning the fried rice is not compulsory in Keung Kee.

Unfortunately, that's also why it's not the best place for people who are unfamiliar with that style of food and decor. 

I have lived in Hong Kong for 1/3 of my life, and Keung Kee reminds me of the typical restaurants there. The chef is able to reproduce a lot of the tastes and flavours I'm accustomed to eating in HK - often giving nostalgia a tickle. They also have a pretty decent selection of dishes there. 

The staff and decor are reminiscent of HK as well. The staff do not speak French, and, in fact, hardly speaks English at all. They are neither rude or friendly, which is typical of Asian restaurants. The decor, with its colours and oversized drapes, are very much like the ones you would find in HK.

I wouldn't normally recommend this place to the average Joe. However, if you're feeling particular adventurous and are eager to try out a really authentic HK restaurant, then this place is for you.","4 star rating"

My biggest complaint is that the mushroom, bamboo vegetable dish was too oily and starchy.  Delicious, but definitely not healthy.  This also seems to be a characteristic of most of the restaurants in Chinatown.

I will definitely go back here at some point, but it wasn't so spectacular that I need to go back tomorrow.  But it's better than similar restaurants on de la Gauchetiere below it.

When I asked what happened to the noodles and BBQ pork only, the waiter said that the restaurant just ran out of noodles.  Okay you ran out noodles, but what happened to my preference for BBQ pork only? 

I think that the restaurant opened up at 11:30am.  My fiance and I were there at 12:00pm.  How can they run out of noodles within a half hour of opening???  

Second, my fiance ordered sesame chicken with jelly fish for $12.95. The waitress tells my fiance that they are out of sesame chicken, but they can replace it with yellow chicken.  

When we got the bill, there was an additional $5.00 tacked on for the yellow chicken.  The original dish was $12.95.  The new price for the chicken dish was $17.95.  When we asked what the price increase was for, we were told that the price went up because they replaced the dish with a different kind of chicken.  

It would have been nice if they told us of the increase in price rather than assuming that everything would be okay.  It is the same with my wonton noodle soup.  They never told me of any changes.  They just brought out my dish.  This is so wrong!

Five dollars isn't a whole lot of money.  It is just the principle that we were getting ripped off.  We complained about what they did.  After going back and forth for a little while, they finally corrected the bill.

As for the food, the yellow chicken was very tough and not that tasty.  Where the wonton soup os concerned, the wonton tasted okay, but the soup base was kind of bland.

We will not be returning back to this clip joint.   Be aware of their shady tactics if you decide to dine here.","1 star rating"

I ordered Veggie PadThai & Szechuan Tofu. 

The PadThai was tasted exactly like stir-fry noodles with peanuts. There was no tamarind sauce. No salt. No red chilli flakes. The PadThai competes with the worst I've had and wins hands down. The only way I could tell it was PadThai was from the lemon wedge it was served with. 

The Szechuan Tofu was just fried tofu with green pepper & onions in Soy sauce. Where is the spice ? Where are the chillis ? Or have they invented some new Szechuan sauce which is exactly soy sauce ?

For anyone planning a visit, beware. The food is not worth it. It was forgetful, bordering on breaking your beliefs on Chinese & Thai cuisine.

Then I asked to substitute shrimp for chicken and he wasn't happy. He looked annoyed even when my boyfriend asked for a brisk tea. Horrible customer service. 

For food, it was also horrible. The pork belly was very bland and the noodle was also bland. I usually pack leftover but I didn't even bother. The sweet and sour soup also tasted water down. I can understand why they are so slow, bad food and horrible customer service. I wouldn't recommend anyone to come eat here. We were the only customers(then finally saw two customers walked in).

Lastly, when I paid upfront. He had the nerve to tell me that tips wasn't included so I told him tips is on the table.

While I strolling through the menu, I general Tao eggplant, and it grabbed my attention. We had general Tao chicken and eggplant and beef chow mein. We each enjoyed our dishes thoroughly. My eggplant dish was mind blowing. The only downside is the food were tad much oily. At this point, PM is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants.","4 star rating"

The receptionist was pretty short and rude. Ordered take out and I ordered the Pad Thai. A very simple dish. Sad to say I was not impressed. It was very bland and the ingredients were not great. For example, there was celery in the pad Thai. Why is there celery in my Pad Thai? They also used the thin vermicelli noodle. Very strange pad Thai. I will not be ordering pad Thai here ever again! I may try something else though like a general tso chicken.","2 star rating"

The service is fast, the food is inexpensive (they have lunch specials for 8$ includes soup and meal), and they accept cards.

I got the general tao chicken with a won ton soup and Adam got the sesame chicken with the spicy soup.

The spicy soup was too spicy! I recommend getting the won ton.
Both of our meals were good. The little salad on the side was the only thing that looked a bit bleh. It was just lettuce on a plate so nothing appetizing about that.

I ordered Veggie PadThai & Szechuan Tofu. 

The PadThai was tasted exactly like stir-fry noodles with peanuts. There was no tamarind sauce. No salt. No red chilli flakes. The PadThai competes with the worst I've had and wins hands down. The only way I could tell it was PadThai was from the lemon wedge it was served with. 

The Szechuan Tofu was just fried tofu with green pepper & onions in Soy sauce. Where is the spice ? Where are the chillis ? Or have they invented some new Szechuan sauce which is exactly soy sauce ?

For anyone planning a visit, beware. The food is not worth it. It was forgetful, bordering on breaking your beliefs on Chinese & Thai cuisine.

I called back to tell them the feedback and I was yelled at. First time ever that a restaurant yells at a customer who pays for his food. 

Way to go ! Restaurant PM is the epitome of how to behave with a customer.","1 star rating"

I literally just got done eating from here and I have to say, the servers were RUDE! The first server was upset because I said, I wasn't ready to order so she walked off(started speaking Chinese) and have the guy come take our order. Then I asked to substitute shrimp for chicken and he wasn't happy. He looked annoyed even when my boyfriend asked for a brisk tea. Horrible customer service. 

For food, it was also horrible. The pork belly was very bland and the noodle was also bland. I usually pack leftover but I didn't even bother. The sweet and sour soup also tasted water down. I can understand why they are so slow, bad food and horrible customer service. I wouldn't recommend anyone to come eat here. We were the only customers(then finally saw two customers walked in).

Lastly, when I paid upfront. He had the nerve to tell me that tips wasn't included so I told him tips is on the table. I am not a bad tipper, I usually tip well but sorry, for services that bad, he deserved the tip I left for him. Yes, it was even less than 15%.

We had General Tao, seafood soup, japanese tofu with eggplant and pork, shrimp mayo, and salt and pepper pork chops. It was not my first time going to P.M, since it is really close to school and relatively cheap, I often go there for lunch. Waiters are usually really nice, they speak english and french, which is rare for a chinese restaurant, and are able to answer any questions about the menu. 
Most of the dishes come in great portions, from the one we ordered, only the general tao and shrimp mayo disapointed us in size (usually, I am satisfied with the portion given). 

Most of the dishes I had today were good. Soup was nice and hot, perfect for a winter night. Jap tofu had a really smooth texture as always, I always go for it whenever I got there. They gave us a really big serving of salt and pepper pork chop, which also tasted good. Shrimp mayo had a bit of a mushy texture (maybe because we didn't eat it fast enough).

The hot and sour soup was a bit runny but it tasted right. The chow mein is is not so crispy but the sauce is perfect. Aside from the chicken, everything else seems a bit off, but the price and service more than makes up for it.

We had the 'japanese tofu with eggplants and minced pork' and the 'half BBQ duck with special sauce'

Japanese tofu: Good food, but I've tasted much better ones in other restaurants. This one simply lacked flavor all around. It seems like the flavors didn't come out due to unknown reasons, I haven't seen it being cooked so I can't tell what went wrong. Same ingredients, same dish, but lacking flavor. 

Duck with special sauce: I've also had better duck in sketchy chinatown places. The 'special sauce' mainly consisted of hoisin sauce. It was average tasting.

Overall impression: very average tasting food. It's food that can be cooked by almost anyone with a palate and a bit of experience.","3 star rating"

I highly recommend ordering their minced pork, Japanese fried Tofu and eggplant casserole. It is absolutely a favorite of mine. I would have it again any day. I don't know where they get the tofu but it was amazingly flavored and melted right in my mouth. I cannot emphasize how good it was and I am very hard to please.

We also got their sweet and sour soup which was agreeably balanced with maybe a touch too much vinegar.

I went again during lunch time at some point and ordered from their lunch menu. The food wasn't exactly bad but it came nothing close to the casserole. Get the casserole! 

The price was good. The portions are generous and very fair. Our waiter was very friendly and actually replaced water by tea free of charge when we asked for something hot to drink.

However, the service is terrible there. Sure they pour out the beer in front of us, but that doesn't do anything if the rest of the service is slow and takes several minutes between dishes to come out. It just left most of us hungry and impatient.

The icing on the cake is that they have the gut to force us to pay 10% in an extremely unfriendly matter. Because the service was slow, I tipped very little, but she kept insisting I have to pay more even though it was apparent I was reluctant.

My friend heard very good reviews of this resto. We decided to take a visit today as a post-exam celebration. Sadly enough, it did not live up to our expectations. The food wasn't as good as other places and was almost room temperature. However, that was fine, I didn't expect authentic Asian cuisine. The pinnacle of this downfall spiral was the bill. As the night progressed, service was relatively okay - they refilled our glasses very quickly and were friendly and polite. 

However, when we went to pay the bill, two things happened. Firstly, the manager refused to take my credit card, even though they took Interac and had a VISA/MasterCard sticker on their counter and window. So I opted to pay in cash. When she was getting my change, she clenched it tightly hovering over my hand and struggled to mutter that my bill didn't include the tip. I nodded at her and waited for her to drop it in my hand, but she kept clutching onto it for the next minute until another customer came through the door.

I'm not picky on service, but withholding someone's change out of self-entitlement ruins any night. I still tipped her, but definitely never going again. I ever find myself forced into this restaurant again under these circumstances, I would take all my change and leave. 

Furthermore, although they may had been polite while speaking to us in English. I couldn't help but overhear them gossiping about my friend and I in Cantonese while we were finishing our meal. 

A really big bummer, to say the least.","2 star rating"

You walk into the usual predictable ""decor,"" and I use that term loosely. Tables, chairs, white walls, a photo or two of the motherland, a few tchotchkes on or around the cash register. 

The food, though, is incredible for two things: One, you order and it nearly instantaneously comes out of the kitchen piping hot. My first reaction was that I was just screwed into eating a reheated pile of leftovers sitting around, but it was, in fact, totally whipped up on the spot. Two, the food is bloody good. Beijing duck, hot chicken pot or whatever it's called, sesame beef, spicy eggplant, it was all excellent and totally delicious. And cheap too - four people, $62 tax in. Not bad at all - when's the last time you ate well for under a twenty in this inflation-riddled city?

Anyway, after a long day of biking and walking around, my sister and I headed over to Kazu for dinner.  We got there at 9:31pm.  It closed at 9:30pm.  Sad...so sad. (N.B. It may been 9:01 and 9:00...but you get it.)

I was hungry.  My sister was hungry.  We no longer cared what we ate.

My sister suggested P.M.  She said it's the only Chinese restaurant in downtown Montreal that she and her friends will eat it.  

When it comes to ambience and environment, a Chinese restaurant is like the average girl.  You do one, you've done them all.  Sorry, was that too brazen? 

P.M. is no different.  It had the usual white table cloth and that subtle clean but unclean feeling.  Nothing some tea can't fix.  Service was just as quick-quick, but friendly.  I ordered up my favourite dish: ""gong chow how woah wow"" (my Chinese friends are REELING right now...I totally butchered their language, meh).  The waiter knew what I was saying - beef fried rice noodles, and eggplant and tofu.

The food was good, a little better than average.  I didn't take photos because when my sister asked if I was going to post about P.M. I said ""no...it's Chinese"".  But then...random friend of a friend asked me if there were good Chinese restaurants in Montreal.  Ding, ding, ding.  I always forget that there are people out there who love them some Chinese.

It was crazy busy on a Friday night, but we only had a quick 10 minute wait for a table. Just be ready to share a table if there aren't many open spots. The staff was friendly and attentive and took time to answer our questions despite how busy they were. The hot and sour soup was amazing. We had some peppered beef and chicken with broccoli, pretty simple dishes but both were flavorful and very good. I walked out of there feeling full and satisfied and not like I just ate a big greasy meal. Which for me, is a sign of good cooking.

The last straw for me came when I placed a phone order and came in to pick it up. I experienced some truly horrible customer service. I described my order to the guy at the counter, who said it wasn't ready yet (I came at the time I was told on the phone) and I should have a seat. In the meantime, he charges me for the food ($13, sounded low to me) and asks me to have a seat.

Furthermore, if you can't find what you're looking for on the menu, they'll modify a meat selection to suit you. I highly recommend their salt and pepper crispy tofu, as well as their General Tao tofu. Their noodle dishes are great as well; I like the finer noodles and they are always crispy and flavourful. The vegetables are fresh and the sauces thick and savoury (I'm getting hungry thinking about it)! They're open late, which is awesome but (and this is a bit of a downer) they tend to give you the bum's rush if you're there too close to closing time. The only negative thing (and it isn't a bad thing if you're in a rush) is that if you order several different dishes, they all come at once, i.e., you'll still be working on your soup and your two or three other dishes will be sitting on the table getting cold.

However, the food, for how pricey it was, was really bland. The beef was really tough, and had the consistency of shoe leather, and the fried rice was dry and flavorless. The soup was just heated water. Perhaps they were having a bad night, but thoroughly disappointing.","1 star rating"

1. The food is authentic Chinese and realllyyy delicious. I ALWAYS get the eggplant & tofu dish (best!!!), 

2. Service is quick and food comes out in a blink! 

3. Personally I'm not Chinese and usually prefer to avoid Chinese restaurants because I am not a fan of generic general tao and fried balls but PM's food offers AUTHENTIC cuisine which I think also caters for everyone's taste buds. 

4. Complimentary dessert of either: taro & tapioca or sweet red bean soup

CONS:
1. The food is verryyy oily... but I suppose that's where the flavor and texture comes from? 

2. I would give PM 5 stars if the decor was nicer and the service was a taaad friendlier.

OVERALL:
-PM's a good place for quick, casual eats with friends & fam.
-Get the Eggplant Tofu dish. You will not regret it!
-This is my Go-To place for Chinese food.","4 star rating"

1)  If you seek authentic Chinese food, it's a good sign when you see lots of Chinese people eating there.
2)  Most authentice Chinese restaurants have two menus, one is filled with westernized Chinese food (think orange chicken, egg foo young), the other contains ""real"" authentic Chinese dishes.  In some restaurants they will hand you one menu as opposed to the other, depending on if you are Chinese or non-Chinese.  In some places they will hand you both, which is what they do here (or was it because we had a ""mixed"" party, with myself and two non-Chinese people, hmmm...)  At this place, the booklet menu is the western one, the oversized one-page menu is the Chinese one, and contains more adventurous dishes like steamed whole fish, so choose accordingly.
3)  Family style dining is what Chinese people typically do.  That means we order for everyone and we share all the dishes, instead of each person having their own plate of food.  Try it, it's fun.

Now, for the review.  This is an acceptable Chinese restaurant, which by my high standards means it's decent, especially considering that there's not as big of a Chinese population in Montreal, at least compared to other Canadian cities like Toronto, Vancouver, or San Francisco in the U.S., where I live.  I was really keeping my expectations low, because it's also in a very touristy part of town.  That said, I was just relieved that the dishes were not overly oily and sugary, which tends to be the case in many restaurants that cater to western taste.  They have a decent selection of authentic Chinese/Cantonese dishes, including steamed whole fish, boiled chicken, stir-fried lobster in a ginger scallion sauce, etc.  I also had a bowl of shrimp wonton noodle soup here another day, which has wontons stuffed with fresh shrimps and ground pork, along with nice and firm egg noodles.

Again, not great by my high standard, but OK enough that I would eat here whenever I'm in the area, which is saying a lot.

P.S.  Fortunes from the cookies are funnier if you add ""in bed"" at the end.","3 star rating"

I'm a creature of habit and wish they would just make my ""favourite"" like they used to, rather than me try to find a replacement on their menu. There are too many other consistently good restaurants in mtl to bother.","2 star rating"

PM's food pales in comparison and often feels too ""fried"", fatty and bland in taste.

After my first 3 choices (including Kazu- insert sad face) were either closed or unfindable, I stumbled upon this place. I asked an exiting patron how the food was. She said it was good, cheap, and recommended the eggplant dish. I entered. I had the eggplant dish (#36) and steamed dumplings. The dumplings were mediocre. I've made better tasting ones at home. The eggplant dish was fine, but again, I've had much better Asian eggplant dishes. It was a large serving with huge chunks of fried tofu. I found the sauce to be bland. The service was cut and dry at first, but he eventually warmed up a bit. With all the other great options around here, I would not eat here again.","2 star rating"

I have nothing but good things to say about the food. From the hot and sour soup to the chicken with ginger, it was all delicious. The portions were huge, and the food was of the highest quality.

This would've easily been five stars except for the service. Despite not being very busy, I was seated at one end of a six-person table that had a couple (apparently on a first date) sitting on the other side. Awkward. 

When I went to pay my check ($15), the owner refused to accept my debit card, despite a sign that stated ""credit card minimum: $30, debit card minimum: $5"". He insisted that my debit card was a credit card because of the Visa logo and would not be swayed, not even by me pointing out the word ""DEBIT"" printed on the card. When I paid with $20 cash, he would not give me $1 bills so that I could leave a proper tip. 

Quirky service happens. The food is too good to not go back. Next time I'll bring small bills.","4 star rating"

Located in the heart of downtown, its surrounded by stiff competition. I actually used to go to WOK cafe down the street for all my chinese needs but had a change of heart after trying PM one day. Its lunch special is unmatched! At 7.99$ for your choice of wonton or hot and sour soup with your choice of main plate from black pepper beef to general tao chicken (generous portions), yet not too much food, the deal has me coming back time and time again. They even honour this price for take out during the lunch hour. This restaurant is also great for groups. They have several large rotating round tables that allow for groups to order several dishes to share. Just don't expect a fancy type restaurant cause its not, but it is worth a visit for a casual Chinese lunch. Their delivery using the ""Just Eat"" app is however terrible. Both times we ordered and specified that the delivery time be for 8pm, both times, they brought it for 6:30 pm, which is completely unacceptable.","3 star rating"

Our bowls of pho came next and they were piping hot, very generously filled with lots of protein and the broth was so delicious. There were lots of noodles and they were just the perfect texture with a little bit of a bite to them. There was lots of lime, beansprouts and basil served on the side.

Decided to order pho from this restaurant from Uber Eats and was not disappointed. Food arrived promptly, quality packaging and generous portions! I've never been to the restaurant in person yet, but I plan to go at a later possible date for the complete experience!

Tip: If you order delivery, reheat the soup so it's super hot and fresh when you add it to your rice noodles :)","5 star rating"

They open on late hours during this pandemic so it is pretty convenient when you don't feel like cooking and you are walking nearby. You just order inside, then wait outside, 10 min later your order will be ready. So they put the broth in one container and then the rest in a soup pot. When you arrive home, you can combine the whole thing so your noodles don't become mushy. Broth is pretty tasty. On this picture I tried the meatballs option, but I prefer another option that they have which has all sorts of meats, that one is very good. I also ordered a grilled chicken and it was very good as well. They will add as well very nice sauces on the side like Hoisin sauce or hot sauce, and some mung bean sprouts and mint. And of course, they do have delivery.","4 star rating"

However I was not that impressed by the food. I ordered the mini pho + the vermicelli with chicken and egg roll. Came out to $20 with tip. Not that bad but not that cheap either. The food was a bit too salty (pho) and too sweet (vietnamese dipping sauce) for my taste. I usually like to drink the broth but I couldn't without risking heartburn. The waitress was very lackluster. No smile, and didn't give me any water. I might return if I'm in the area but wouldn't actively go there.

Another small incident that happened was that the lady at the cash pulled my arm and said that the tip was not enough when I did enter a 15% tip for a pho order of about 10$ and turned around to leave, so I put another loonie on the counter without thinking, and only then I saw they charged me for a large bowl even though I actually had a medium bowl.

 I've been to this place a couple of time and I gotta say, their pho soup is tasty, the meat are tendered.
The decor of place is trendy, cozy and clean. Especially the location, it's right in the heart of downtown (Guy Corcordia) area. If you need a quick fix of Pho, this is the place.

Now you may wonder why I gave 2 stars and not more, it is due to my most recent experience. I ordered delivery and it had a small little problem... And when I reported the issue to the restaurant, their reaction is unacceptable.
So I ordered, 1 regular size & 1 extra large pho. When it arrived, they have identify on the box which one is which but when I open box and realize both has the same amount of meat and noodles. So I decided to make a courtoisie and report the issue. Instead of listening to my comment, the worker (not sure if it's the owner or just their waitress), started educate me by saying ""it's identified on the box, I don't understand why you are confused bla bla"", I had to yell out ""Would you listen to me first?""
Then she said ""Oh, well since the order is out now there's nothing I can do, when you place an order next time, maybe you can write in the comment"" right there. I lost it, I told her I was not expecting you do anything this time and there will be no next time. This is pretty much a scam. 

They have great food quality and it is so sad to have such a reaction that they are on denial.

I still recommend people to eat there, just be careful on what you order and just don't get any delivery or take out.","2 star rating"

Cons:
Waitress provided terrible service. She automatically set down glasses of cold water and when my mom asked if she could also get a cup of hot water, she snatched the cold water out of my mother's hand and stormed off in a huff. She returned later with what was clearly hot tap water (vs hot boiled water like you would use for tea). My mother literally spit it out because it was so gross.  I would have said something to the waitress  except she never came back once to check on us.  They weren't that busy so there was no excuse for lack of service. 
This waitress, and the other one working, never once cracked a smile.  They seemed miserable and put that misery onto their customers.","2 star rating"

THE REAL NAME IS ""I AM PHO"", BUT BY LOOKING AT THEIR BUSINESS CARD, YOU CAN SEE WHY IT'S EASY TO MISS THE REAL NAME. 

Wow, what a great find. I flew into Montreal, just for one night. I only really had time to venture for a quick lunch, right after checking into the Best Western Ville Marie. My cellphone was having trouble connecting to the data celular line while I walked and so my trusty Yelp app was rendered unusable. I proceeded to walk aimlessly, trying to follow the bands of students who seemed to come and go though different halls of Magill university. I asked around without sounding like a homeless person, mostly where the good Asian restaurants where in the area. I had a lust for psome good Thai or Vietnamese, which is always a good bet in Montreal. My previous culinary experiences included ""au pied de cochon"" and various Thai and Middle Eastern joints, but this would only make my third visit to Montreal. Looking for something apparently Vietnamese that a young man pointed towards, I stumbled upon this place. It's a small unassuming room on the second floor of a small building. The menu on a blackboard on the wall but also mini blackboards with specials of the day. I had the cold rolls for an appetizer which were very fresh and generous. The sauce was very appetizing. I then had the grilled pork chop pho, a regular menu item on the board. The pork was cooked really well and it had great color as well as taste. The rice vermicelli was delightful and so were the ingredients that completed this simple and effective dish. The lady that attended me was courteous but unusually honest and suggested what would be the proper amount of food for me to order. Therefore, she adviced against ordering both the ""three color coconut"" and the Vietnamese coffee. ""too much sweet"", she said. Although I have been to Hanoi and had plenty of such coffee at the hotel, she brought a small metal percolator that sat on top of the coffee cup and also a big mug full of ice. After I got over my embarrassment of not understanding what's going on, I asked for help. She told me that I had to wait until all of the coffee had drained to the bottom, then stir the condensed milk at the bottom vigorously. Only after that, I should really pour over the hot coffee into the iced mug. I vacilated, somehow I wanted my coffee hot, but once again and very frankly, she indicated that it'd be best to water down a little because it's otherwise too sweet. And she was right! It was both coffee and dessert. I spoke to the owner briefly, mostly because I tried to talk him out of playing the ""Asian pop massage new age never-ending"" never resolving music. I said : ""play the music of your grandparents"" the beautiful folk music of monochord and drums, etc. He shrugged my comments and we spoke about new york, Queens, the best Vietnamese restaurants there and, why so many of the ones in the west side closed. He told me that this restaurant is relatively new. I would definitely come back soon if I knew when I will be back. The prices are reasonable and I don't think they will have a problem drawing large crowds.","5 star rating"

We ordered the prix fix meal for 2 and for 48 CAD it wasn't a bad deal.   The 8 ingredient soup was good with shrimp beef and chicken.  Almost like an egg drop soup with more meat.   

The rest of the meal was good but the peanut chicken was odd. It came with fried spinach and a fake Thai sauce.  Definitely not Viet.

The last time I came here was back in the early nineties, it was reminiscent of a bamboo tiki decor back then. I has been renovated since then and it looks much more upscale now.

One of my colleague at work wanted to try vietnamese cuisine, and I thought bringing her to one of those Pho place probably wouldn't do the trick, So naturally I thought of Ong Ca Can and Bo 7 mon.

I believe it is still the only place in MTL that serves Bo 7 mon, which means 7 beef dishes. And at 46$ for two it is well priced, if you want cheaper you have to go to california to get that (try Pagolac).

Traditionally, these themed dishes are served together in a festive setting for special occasions like weddings. As beef is somewhat more expensive than other meats in vietnam, it is generally held in high regard to serve/or be served bo 7 mon. Not to mention it takes a lot of work to make all seven, so it is not often eaten and people are usually excited about these dishes.

1. rice soup with minced beef

2. beef fondue

3. grilled beef wrapped in caul fat

4. grilled beef in Lolot pepper leaves

5. grilled beef wrapped around onions

6. beef steak (vietnamese style)

7. Steamed beef meatloaf with shrimp chips

The beef fondue comes with a side of herbs, lettuce, bean sprouts, carrots, cucumbers and pickled daicon radishes.

Then you also get a half moon bowl of hot water and rice paper. the rice paper is dry and you dip it in the water just to coat it all around with water and then place it flat on your plate. Then you cook the beef in the fondue broth and place it in the rice wrapper along with all the herbs lettuce and whatever else you want. then you make a roll and then dip it in the sauce and eat.

The sauce is made with fermented anchovies and pineapple puree. Don't worry it doesn't smell that much they have toned it down here, it is very nicely done.

For items 3-5 you can also roll in the rice wrapper and dip in the sauce.

The steak you just eat it, it is sliced thinner than regular steak, and it is a small piece and it is done medium, but slightly charbroiled on the outside.

The meat loaf comes at the end, you get a half moon portion served with shrimp chip.

My coworkers were very impressed with the multi course meal. It did alter their perception that viet food was Pho and little else. It was a cultural experience for them which was very profound and I'm glad to be their guide.

Don't worry if you order this and you don't have a guide with you , the waiters will show you how it's done. I know everyone has had Pho before, want to rediscover vietnamese food? come here, order Bo 7 Mon... you won't regret it.","4 star rating"

We ordered the bo 7 mon.   Priced at $46!  The highest I have ever seen.   In Toronto,  I saw it priced at $30 and that was the highest I ever saw. 

They served the beef congee first here and it was pretty good.   But a bit short on the beef side.   Than out came the beef fondue.  The raw beef looked cleaned and pretty good as well.   We than had all the bbq beef next.   This place served a beef ball rather than the beef salad.   The other beef rolls were pretty much the same.   I was however a bit disappointed... everywhere I went,  bo 7 mon always had bo lo luc.  This place decided not to make it as one of the seven dishes. Other places will usually vary on the other beef dishes but,  bo lo luc should always be part of it. 

Other than that. .. the food was pretty good.   But the question is. ... will I come again. .. and unfortunately I will have to say no.   The price did not justify the quality.

Try the ""Bo Bay Mon"" (7 course beef). You will not be disappointed! It's 45$ for 2 people and you will not be dissapointed! They have a wine list, not extensive (but very good for a vietnamese restaurant). Dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine will cost around 130$ (Tip included).

We ordered the prix fix meal for 2 and for 48 CAD it wasn't a bad deal.   The 8 ingredient soup was good with shrimp beef and chicken.  Almost like an egg drop soup with more meat.   

The rest of the meal was good but the peanut chicken was odd. It came with fried spinach and a fake Thai sauce.  Definitely not Viet.

The last time I came here was back in the early nineties, it was reminiscent of a bamboo tiki decor back then. I has been renovated since then and it looks much more upscale now.

One of my colleague at work wanted to try vietnamese cuisine, and I thought bringing her to one of those Pho place probably wouldn't do the trick, So naturally I thought of Ong Ca Can and Bo 7 mon.

I believe it is still the only place in MTL that serves Bo 7 mon, which means 7 beef dishes. And at 46$ for two it is well priced, if you want cheaper you have to go to california to get that (try Pagolac).

Traditionally, these themed dishes are served together in a festive setting for special occasions like weddings. As beef is somewhat more expensive than other meats in vietnam, it is generally held in high regard to serve/or be served bo 7 mon. Not to mention it takes a lot of work to make all seven, so it is not often eaten and people are usually excited about these dishes.

1. rice soup with minced beef

2. beef fondue

3. grilled beef wrapped in caul fat

4. grilled beef in Lolot pepper leaves

5. grilled beef wrapped around onions

6. beef steak (vietnamese style)

7. Steamed beef meatloaf with shrimp chips

The beef fondue comes with a side of herbs, lettuce, bean sprouts, carrots, cucumbers and pickled daicon radishes.

Then you also get a half moon bowl of hot water and rice paper. the rice paper is dry and you dip it in the water just to coat it all around with water and then place it flat on your plate. Then you cook the beef in the fondue broth and place it in the rice wrapper along with all the herbs lettuce and whatever else you want. then you make a roll and then dip it in the sauce and eat.

The sauce is made with fermented anchovies and pineapple puree. Don't worry it doesn't smell that much they have toned it down here, it is very nicely done.

For items 3-5 you can also roll in the rice wrapper and dip in the sauce.

The steak you just eat it, it is sliced thinner than regular steak, and it is a small piece and it is done medium, but slightly charbroiled on the outside.

The meat loaf comes at the end, you get a half moon portion served with shrimp chip.

My coworkers were very impressed with the multi course meal. It did alter their perception that viet food was Pho and little else. It was a cultural experience for them which was very profound and I'm glad to be their guide.

Don't worry if you order this and you don't have a guide with you , the waiters will show you how it's done. I know everyone has had Pho before, want to rediscover vietnamese food? come here, order Bo 7 Mon... you won't regret it.","4 star rating"

We ordered the bo 7 mon.   Priced at $46!  The highest I have ever seen.   In Toronto,  I saw it priced at $30 and that was the highest I ever saw. 

They served the beef congee first here and it was pretty good.   But a bit short on the beef side.   Than out came the beef fondue.  The raw beef looked cleaned and pretty good as well.   We than had all the bbq beef next.   This place served a beef ball rather than the beef salad.   The other beef rolls were pretty much the same.   I was however a bit disappointed... everywhere I went,  bo 7 mon always had bo lo luc.  This place decided not to make it as one of the seven dishes. Other places will usually vary on the other beef dishes but,  bo lo luc should always be part of it. 

Other than that. .. the food was pretty good.   But the question is. ... will I come again. .. and unfortunately I will have to say no.   The price did not justify the quality.

Heard from the locals that this is THE place to go for Bo 7 Mon (7 Beef Dishes) and they were all right!

My husband, my aunt, my mom, and I all agree that this is the best place for Bo 7 Mon.  We've never experienced better restaurant grade Bo 7 Mon ... ever!!!!

All the beef dishes were flavourful and tender; and prepared in quite a refined way.  

A lot of veggies - lettuce, mint, basil, carrots, pickled daikon radish, cucumber, other leaf herbs I don't know the name of - are included but there is the option of ordering extra (for a charge) if you run out.  

The rice paper was amazing ... thin and never tore?!  I want to know the brand of that rice paper!!!!

One of the highlights of the meal was the dipping sauce ... OMG ... it is a shrimp/ anchovy based sauce called mam nem.  It is probably the best mam nem I've ever tried.  It was little spicy and just perfect ... with bits of crushed pineapple ... oh YUM!!!!!  

No vermicelli noodles were included - that would be extra if you so require.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous - not your stereotypical Vietnamese restaurant (sorry stereotypical Vietnamese restaurants).  High loft like ceilings, dark wood, modern decor, glass ... beautiful!  There was definitely an upscale vibe.  

Cost of the Bo 7 Mon is $42/ 2 people.  

I wasn't stuffed silly but left pleasantly satisfied.

p.s. - No Highchairs

Many places tend to claim to serve it up. Thaison I would declare the best I've had in Montreal for Char Siu (Chinese BBQ pork). It's such a delicate mix of well cooked pork almost candied on the outside, yet not too dry and tender on the inside. They offer to cut it up for you or have it uncut. I asked for uncut as I thought it would be fresher bringing back home. I ended up cutting some for my daughter and right after she put it in her mouth she said ""daddy more please"". It's really hard for me to use descriptive terms to explain. A tad firm on the outside (as in well done) yet tender would be the best I can describe it. It's freaking amazing. I also purchased which was mentioned to me (by Yelper Khai) as Thai lemongrass sausage. It was a bit fatty but very good mix of pork and full lemongrass flavour. Another nice compliment.

Since then, i've tried other Chinese bbq places like this but nothing ever compared to it. Maybe the vietnamese side of it made a difference... Like i have mentioned in other of my reviews around the area, I don't come around often due to traffic and parking issues. But when i do come to Thaison, i always enjoy and love their food. This time i ordered to go a whole roasted  duck, vietnamese sausage with lemongrass, mi vit tiem soup (spiced braised duck with egg noodle soup) and a won ton with roasted duck with egg noodle soup.

The food is inexpensive and filling, but lacking in culinary quality.

This may have been sufficient in 1997, but today there are many asian restaurants in Montreal serving more relevant, delicious, inspired food.

As I noted in another review, there are no vegetables to be found in this restaurant, so if you want to vary your meal beyond roast meats, stir fries and noodle soups, you will be out of luck.  The fried tofu with mushrooms is serviceable, but I don't consider this a vegetable dish.

On top of that, they were out of roast pork.  It is one of the highlights of this restaurant and many people order it to go.

The service is as uninspired as the food.  The careless waitstaff clearly do not want to be there- they are only there because they were there yesterday and don't know what else to do.

It's really hard for me to use descriptive terms to explain. A tad firm on the outside (as in well done) yet tender would be the best I can describe it. It's freaking amazing. I also purchased which was mentioned to me (by Yelper Khai) as Thai lemongrass sausage. It was a bit fatty but very good mix of pork and full lemongrass flavour. Another nice compliment. 

If BBQ Chinese/Asian meats are on your list you need to come here. The shop is very unassuming and service is direct and no nonsense but it's the real deal folks.","5 star rating"

Since then, i've tried other Chinese bbq places like this but nothing ever compared to it. Maybe the vietnamese side of it made a difference... Like i have mentioned in other of my reviews around the area, I don't come around often due to traffic and parking issues. But when i do come to Thaison, i always enjoy and love their food. This time i ordered to go a whole roasted  duck, vietnamese sausage with lemongrass, mi vit tiem soup (spiced braised duck with egg noodle soup) and a won ton with roasted duck with egg noodle soup. At under 10$ a soup, 20$ for a whole duck and 4,50$ worth of sausage, my husband and i had enough food for 3-4 meals! All i needed to do is cook some fragrant jasmine rice and pop open a good bottle of beer (or a few) and we're set! Bon appétit!!! 

Btw, service is ok. I guess it all depends on how the day is unfolding to them ;)
I love it more when it is or was the older gentleman at the butcher table and not the younger version. Still ok though ^_^","4 star rating"

The food is inexpensive and filling, but lacking in culinary quality.

This may have been sufficient in 1997, but today there are many asian restaurants in Montreal serving more relevant, delicious, inspired food.

As I noted in another review, there are no vegetables to be found in this restaurant, so if you want to vary your meal beyond roast meats, stir fries and noodle soups, you will be out of luck.  The fried tofu with mushrooms is serviceable, but I don't consider this a vegetable dish.

On top of that, they were out of roast pork.  It is one of the highlights of this restaurant and many people order it to go.

The service is as uninspired as the food.  The careless waitstaff clearly do not want to be there- they are only there because they were there yesterday and don't know what else to do.

This is a restaurant that has fallen into a death spiral and cannot find its way out.  Such a shame, because it could be much better","3 star rating"

I lived around the corner from here for years and it took reviews from trusted Yelpers to help me finally discover this deliciousness! For when pho is not enough and you really want to get into some seriously good Vietnamese meats, get yourself to Thaison. The homemade lemongrass pork sausage was super tasty and the roast duck soup with egg noodles was crazy rich and filling with lovely savoury broth. I want to go back with a crew of people to order the hot pot and a bunch of other stuff on the menu that I need more professional eaters to introduce me to, but yah, what a happy discovery!

Don't go here .... This is the thing ... I believes it was a "" Thai restaurant "" or at least so kind of  real Thai joint ... I came in and the look of the good was good ....

So basically you are paying 13 cad for a dish  of microwaved ""Thai "" food ...do yourself a favor, buy frozen food and go home , you won't see nothing exceptional here 

Oh and btw .. First time they microwaved it .. It was only hot on the top .. So imagine general tao Chiken cold ... I asked to put it again on the microwave ...Oh my god !!! I left 3 minutes ago after realizing that bond of The 3 dishes was even eatable ....

I went here OFTEN and then, however, I read an article in Globe and Mail that the pad thai here is ridiculously fattening. Like over 1,200 calores fattening. I mean, I guess it makes sense considering the portions are mountainous and the use of what appears to be oil is more than generous but still it ruined it for me. I always thought 'oh Thai express if a healthy fast good option!' but I was WRONG, wrong I tell you. And now I wonder why I gained those freshmen 15 lbs! Ha! The truth is out.

I'm American and I've been on the search for a place similar to Panda Express that sells Americanized Asian food in Canada, and Thai Express is honestly the next best thing. I can't speak for all their other dishes but the tofu pad Thai is DELICIOUS. I always order it extra spicy without bean sprouts and drown it in Sriracha and crushed peanuts; I know it doesn't sound the most appetizing but if you're a spicy food lover like myself TRY IT!!","4 star rating"

This wasn't that bad, as it was our first time so we took our time deciding what to try first. But when the employee came out, he looked directly past my boyfriend and I standing in front of the cash register and began taking the order of the Asian man beside us who had just walked in. 

I'm seeing a sad and scary trend of racist Asians in this city, it's bad enough being treated like a peasant from québécois who resent speaking English. It may not be as easy to communicate in English as it is whatever other language you speak, but having a discriminatory attitude in public is just as damaging to society as it is to your reputation so please keep that in mind.

Fried dumplings 
Papaya salad
Cambodian Classic Meat soup 
Beef noodle dish
Durian smoothie

Asie Moderne is diamond in the ruff for so many reasons.
Like most authentic Asian restaurants it's decor or external facade won't win it any design awards; it's cooking on the other hand... Wow.

 I've been coming here for many years and I think the reason I love it so much is because it's different. They specialize in Cambodia cuisine which isn't something many Montréal restaurants offer. The cuisine is like a mix of Korean BBQ and the richness of Chinese Szechwan. They also offer other Asian dishes, the classic pad Thai, general Tao etc... If you want a truly memorable meal ask the waiter for the signature Cambodian dishes. 

If you like trying new things and aren't picky I would suggest trying the Cambodian soup, a very unique citrus lemon grass broth with some veggies and a lot of delicious beef. 

I would also recommend the Papaya salad, which is kind of like a refreshing coleslaw taste to it, but with a spicy kick. 

Lastly try the Durian smoothie. It might not be for everyone, as the waiter told us it's a hit or miss kind of drink and our table proved his point. Me and my girlfriend loved it, while our two other friends hated the taste.","4 star rating"

The soup was very good, somerhing like a tom yum soup.  It had lemongrass, tomato, celery, and straw mushroom.  The fried rice was also good, especially with the pickled hot peppers that are furnished on every table.

For some reason,we did not receive our broccoli or drinks, and the owner/waiter did not check on us or ask us if we needed anything or advise us that the chinese broccoli is unavailable.

Also, a complaint we have about this and other similar restaurants is that they are ""vegetably challenged"".   They tend to use minimal vegetables of the lowest grade such as celery and carrots, and do not include other asian vegetables such as greens, bamboo, baby corn, mushroom etc, which add variety and flavor.

In this case, there were at least five vegetable dishes on the menu, and the owner/waiter told us three of them were available, yet apparently none of them were available.  It may be that nobody ever orders these and that's fine, but if it's on the menu they should keep it in stock.

This restaurant has been in business 30 years and I guess they do not need our business, but it's unfortunate, as the service,food and experience could be a lot better, and good southeast asian restaurants are sorely needed in Montreal.","2 star rating"

Fried dumplings 
Papaya salad
Cambodian Classic Meat soup 
Beef noodle dish
Durian smoothie

Asie Moderne is diamond in the ruff for so many reasons.
Like most authentic Asian restaurants it's decor or external facade won't win it any design awards; it's cooking on the other hand... Wow.

 I've been coming here for many years and I think the reason I love it so much is because it's different. They specialize in Cambodia cuisine which isn't something many Montréal restaurants offer. The cuisine is like a mix of Korean BBQ and the richness of Chinese Szechwan. They also offer other Asian dishes, the classic pad Thai, general Tao etc... If you want a truly memorable meal ask the waiter for the signature Cambodian dishes. 

If you like trying new things and aren't picky I would suggest trying the Cambodian soup, a very unique citrus lemon grass broth with some veggies and a lot of delicious beef. 

I would also recommend the Papaya salad, which is kind of like a refreshing coleslaw taste to it, but with a spicy kick. 

Lastly try the Durian smoothie. It might not be for everyone, as the waiter told us it's a hit or miss kind of drink and our table proved his point. Me and my girlfriend loved it, while our two other friends hated the taste.","4 star rating"

It is owned by a young husband and wife team, and atleast one of them always happen to be present to wait on you. Because of that fact, here is not much to say about customer service. The wife does not seem like she wants to be there, and can usually be seen shuffling around, from table to table. While the husband atleast makes the effort to provide good service.

The good: The little taster of general tao when you are first sitting was nice. The cute water pitchers mean that you're not waiting for service on refills. Their won-ton soup was quite sweet, although I wouldn't regularly eat it, it was a nice change of pace on the classic soup. The place scores an extra star for being BYOB.

The not so good: our waitress wasn't on her game. I get the flow of service, but she really was nowhere to be found the few times she was needed.  The fried dumplings were unlike I had anywhere before, and their texture kept saying ""churro"" rather than peanut butter dumpling. The main dishes themselves were.. ok. Their classic combos are 3 options, chicken brochette, ginger chicken, or spicy chicken stir fry. My date and I had the ginger chicken and spicy stir fry which ended up being what really bugged me out. The spicy stirfry was literally the ginger chicken dish but with a spoonful of Chiu Chow (chili) sauce on the top, not like it was actually put in during the cooking process to seep. The food was lackluster to say the least, and the decor of the place was a mix of traditional and tiki, then covered in hockey Philadelphia Flyers Christmas themed hockey paraphernalia which just made it an eye sore and removed any possible sense of atmosphere.Overall I don't get why people are so into this place, doubt I'll be back even if I am in the area, Americanized in the worst kind of way.","2 star rating"

We were with a group of friends yesterday evening-  the order took forever to arrive - the staff seemed confused - they kept on thinking and asking if we finished our diner while we didn't had our main dishes -

My friend took a basil/tomato soup and immediately had to go vomit as it got a very bad batch- food poisoning 

My 20$ dish (shrimp general tao) had 5 poor little un-veined and non- battered shrimps with a sauce that resembled to a ketchup sauce
Mixed with sugar  -  the lazy way of making general tao I call it. The vegetables look like as if they were from a frozen bag but hopefully they're not.  I'm not so keen about eating brocoli and carrots in a Vietnamese dish - what happened to bamboo shoots , bean sprout and mushrooms?

My neighbour at the table kept on complaining how his rice was hard to chew and bland. He kept on complaining.

This used to be a great eatery but if they keep on on loosing quality and service- I'm afraid they will start loosing the clientele - we will loose another restaurant in the village.

After reading so many good reviews about this place, I decided to go give it a try. I really wanted a good pho! 

So i got in the restaurant. Warm, cozy atmosphere. There were about 3-4 tables with customers eating. So far so good! I proceeded towards the waitress at the counter and asked if it was possible to order to go. Her reply:""We don't have the sandwich."" Um. Ok. So i asked again to which she said yes. 

Me: Do you have dac biet pho (all dressed pho)?

Lady: No. We only serve pho with rare beef.

Me: Ok...

She interrupts me

Lady: We cater to a ""white"" clientele palate. If you want authentic vietnamese pho, this isn't the place for you. You won't like it here.

WHAT???? 

This was the first time someone says something like this to me. So i simply said thank you and left the restaurant. Was she trying to do me a favour? Was she trying to get rid of me? I don't know anymore. I am perplexed and kinda shocked to be honest. Too bad for her interrupting me. I would of given it a try regardless of the fact they only serve rare beef pho.

The food was very good and the service was friendly, but it was rather slow. We all ordered the same main dish - noodles with meat and an eggroll - and yet the table next to us who arrived after us got their appetizers and main courses before we had anything of ours. Not an awful wait, but a little annoying since they only had 4 tables occupied.

The following Saturday, we had a group of friends over and were planning to order pizza when one suggested Vietnamese. We couldn't find a menu for Cafe Saigon online, unfortunately, so my husband called the restaurant and asked for a suggestion of dishes for 8 people. The gentleman who answered the phone suggested a mix of chicken, beef, and shrimp dishes. We also ordered some eggrolls. We were told the food would be ready in 15 minutes. We went promptly to pick it up and lo and behold, despite the fact that the restaurant was pretty crowded, it was boxed up and ready to go. They were just packing up some sauces and some coriander on the side, and they were kind enough to throw in a few extras, utensils, and fortune cookies. Our guests raved about the food and the price was very reasonable. Everyone was really impressed.

Service was excellent. Server noticed I didn't eat the chicken and comped a shrimp curry. I asked for a small portion and it was great. Same star curry and lovely pieces of generously sized shrimp.

I'd return since I think the chicken issue was an outlier and I can live w/o spring rolls. Will prob get their soup next time - was jealous seeing my friend consume most of the bowl!","4 star rating"

The good: The little taster of general tao when you are first sitting was nice. The cute water pitchers mean that you're not waiting for service on refills. Their won-ton soup was quite sweet, although I wouldn't regularly eat it, it was a nice change of pace on the classic soup. The place scores an extra star for being BYOB.

The not so good: our waitress wasn't on her game. I get the flow of service, but she really was nowhere to be found the few times she was needed.  The fried dumplings were unlike I had anywhere before, and their texture kept saying ""churro"" rather than peanut butter dumpling. The main dishes themselves were.. ok. Their classic combos are 3 options, chicken brochette, ginger chicken, or spicy chicken stir fry. My date and I had the ginger chicken and spicy stir fry which ended up being what really bugged me out. The spicy stirfry was literally the ginger chicken dish but with a spoonful of Chiu Chow (chili) sauce on the top, not like it was actually put in during the cooking process to seep. The food was lackluster to say the least, and the decor of the place was a mix of traditional and tiki, then covered in hockey Philadelphia Flyers Christmas themed hockey paraphernalia which just made it an eye sore and removed any possible sense of atmosphere.Overall I don't get why people are so into this place, doubt I'll be back even if I am in the area, Americanized in the worst kind of way.","2 star rating"

We were with a group of friends yesterday evening-  the order took forever to arrive - the staff seemed confused - they kept on thinking and asking if we finished our diner while we didn't had our main dishes -

My friend took a basil/tomato soup and immediately had to go vomit as it got a very bad batch- food poisoning 

My 20$ dish (shrimp general tao) had 5 poor little un-veined and non- battered shrimps with a sauce that resembled to a ketchup sauce
Mixed with sugar  -  the lazy way of making general tao I call it. The vegetables look like as if they were from a frozen bag but hopefully they're not.  I'm not so keen about eating brocoli and carrots in a Vietnamese dish - what happened to bamboo shoots , bean sprout and mushrooms?

My neighbour at the table kept on complaining how his rice was hard to chew and bland. He kept on complaining.

This used to be a great eatery but if they keep on on loosing quality and service- I'm afraid they will start loosing the clientele - we will loose another restaurant in the village.

So I'll wait for a while or probably never until I go back","2 star rating"

Please let me explain.

After reading so many good reviews about this place, I decided to go give it a try. I really wanted a good pho! 

So i got in the restaurant. Warm, cozy atmosphere. There were about 3-4 tables with customers eating. So far so good! I proceeded towards the waitress at the counter and asked if it was possible to order to go. Her reply:""We don't have the sandwich."" Um. Ok. So i asked again to which she said yes. 

Me: Do you have dac biet pho (all dressed pho)?

Lady: No. We only serve pho with rare beef.

Me: Ok...

She interrupts me

Lady: We cater to a ""white"" clientele palate. If you want authentic vietnamese pho, this isn't the place for you. You won't like it here.

WHAT???? 

This was the first time someone says something like this to me. So i simply said thank you and left the restaurant. Was she trying to do me a favour? Was she trying to get rid of me? I don't know anymore. I am perplexed and kinda shocked to be honest. Too bad for her interrupting me. I would of given it a try regardless of the fact they only serve rare beef pho.

The food was very good and the service was friendly, but it was rather slow. We all ordered the same main dish - noodles with meat and an eggroll - and yet the table next to us who arrived after us got their appetizers and main courses before we had anything of ours. Not an awful wait, but a little annoying since they only had 4 tables occupied.

The following Saturday, we had a group of friends over and were planning to order pizza when one suggested Vietnamese. We couldn't find a menu for Cafe Saigon online, unfortunately, so my husband called the restaurant and asked for a suggestion of dishes for 8 people. The gentleman who answered the phone suggested a mix of chicken, beef, and shrimp dishes. We also ordered some eggrolls. We were told the food would be ready in 15 minutes. We went promptly to pick it up and lo and behold, despite the fact that the restaurant was pretty crowded, it was boxed up and ready to go. They were just packing up some sauces and some coriander on the side, and they were kind enough to throw in a few extras, utensils, and fortune cookies. Our guests raved about the food and the price was very reasonable. Everyone was really impressed.

- Great Food
- Friendly Staff
- Though the decor is pretty cheap like most good Asian restaurants in our city (what's up with that!?), the place is kept pretty clean.

Cons
- Location: It's in a bad part of town; a lot of addicts roam the streets late at night in this area. Therefore, I would suggest to not go there alone at night (just to be safe). Plus, if you park your car in the area, don't leave anything in the backseat as this area is notorious for having smashed windows on the sidewalk.
- Price: My girlfriend and I had a combo and our meal came to 52$ + tip. Though certain things on the menu were cheap, a combo at 26$ at an Asian restaurant is considered pricy.

Don't go there if:
- It's your first date: you can find better priced Asian restaurants (not sure about specifically Vietnamese though) with better atmosphere and in better neighbourhoods.

Do go if:
You're in the area and would like a quick snack (their sandwiches are well priced and tasty).","3 star rating"

I've seen it before on the way to getting my Thai food. It's a small kiosk, what appears to be a man and cooking on a small gas wok cooker and his wife manning the cash register. Food appears to be Taiwanese/Sichuan. I say this as there is a decent amount of garlic and when you order she asks you do you want it spicy or very spicy? My selection was spicy. 

So I ordered one order of pan fried dumplings and a braised eggplant dish plus a country style pork with vegetables dish. What's seriously ridiculous is that each dish is $6.99. Sure it's a food court but they serve this with rice and for this price I question a) how they can make a living at this price and b) how good spicy Chinese food can be so cheap. 

Here's the deal on the food: 

1) pan fried dumplings- pork and corn with a very nice soy dipping sauce with sesame oil and a healthy amount of fresh garlic. Delicious interesting that there was corn in the dumplings and the pork was good not greasy or too fatty! 

2) country style pork- pork with peppers, onions in a very spicy thick black bean infused sauce that had a good amount of spice and flavour over rice. A bit more heavier on the oil side but delicious none the less. 

3) braised Asian eggplant with chicken, peppers, onion celery. Asians love to eat eggplant braised this way.  I can't explain it but you must try it. There is something about the soft texture plus the melding of vegetables, some mixed chicken plus a bit salty but thick sauce that tastes fantastic. Again this dish was a bit heavier on the oil side but over rice was really damm good as well. 

Downside of this place? The fact that it's very small, they can't handle high volume so I'm a bit hesitant submitting this review as if they become more popular the wait will be longer and my guess is the prices will go up. I know selfish but sometimes you question whether you want to keep a secret or share with others. I share as I'd like to see these two do well! I asked how long for my food. She said "" ten minutes"". Because there were a few orders before me it was almost twenty when I received it. 

Come check it out. If you see a few orders ahead of you and you don't have time, there are other great places in the food court especially Bangkok. If you have the time sit back as you are in for a very inexpensive gem treat that you will enjoy.","4 star rating"

Prices are set at 6.99$ which is 8$ after taxes. It's still cheap, but quantity and quality don't measure up to others at the foodcourt. 

Allow me to justify the previous statement: Take a look at my photos and compare to those on the menu (other yelpers have posted them). We all know McDonald's photoshops pictures of their food, but the guys at Chang Lai probably stole theirs straight from the internet.

Indeed, the food tastes just as average as it looks: chunks of badly chopped celery, green pepper, and onion are stir fried in a wok. Throw in about 3oz of meat. Stir another 2min. Voila. 

The chicken was tender and tasted chicken, but didn't blend with the veggies (hard for chunks to release flavour in a 5min stir fry). And the supposed 'braised chicken' had not been braised, it was probably just coated in starch. Asked for spicy, got something that could have been 3x hotter.

The pork intestine has its chew and unique flavour, but the supporting flavours failed to blend in. Again, the spiciness level was underwhelming.

The only reason I'd go back would be when I'm in a pinch -- no waiting line and, as I mentioned above, it's a less than 5min stir fry.","3 star rating"

Another positive is that it is one of the few stalls that are open on Sunday (Indian Place and Yuki Ramen as well).

Each dish is $6.99 plus tax and comes with a bowl of white rice. You order what you like and then the chef makes it fresh to order. They give you a choice of chicken, beef, or pork for some dishes. The food is comparable to what you'd get in a Chinese restaurant, seems to be super authentic, and is pretty tasty.

Anyhow the food at Chang Lai is all good. But I'm especially taken by the braised pig intestines. Normally I can't handle pig intestines. In the past, the strong manure taste of them was simply too much for me. It took me a while to get up the courage to order them here.

Food appears to be Taiwanese/Sichuan. I say this as there is a decent amount of garlic and when you order she asks you do you want it spicy or very spicy? My selection was spicy. 

So I ordered one order of pan fried dumplings and a braised eggplant dish plus a country style pork with vegetables dish. What's seriously ridiculous is that each dish is $6.99. Sure it's a food court but they serve this with rice and for this price I question a) how they can make a living at this price and b) how good spicy Chinese food can be so cheap. 

Here's the deal on the food: 

1) pan fried dumplings- pork and corn with a very nice soy dipping sauce with sesame oil and a healthy amount of fresh garlic. Delicious interesting that there was corn in the dumplings and the pork was good not greasy or too fatty! 

2) country style pork- pork with peppers, onions in a very spicy thick black bean infused sauce that had a good amount of spice and flavour over rice. A bit more heavier on the oil side but delicious none the less. 

3) braised Asian eggplant with chicken, peppers, onion celery. Asians love to eat eggplant braised this way.  I can't explain it but you must try it. There is something about the soft texture plus the melding of vegetables, some mixed chicken plus a bit salty but thick sauce that tastes fantastic. Again this dish was a bit heavier on the oil side but over rice was really damm good as well. 

Downside of this place? The fact that it's very small, they can't handle high volume so I'm a bit hesitant submitting this review as if they become more popular the wait will be longer and my guess is the prices will go up. I know selfish but sometimes you question whether you want to keep a secret or share with others. I share as I'd like to see these two do well! I asked how long for my food. She said "" ten minutes"". Because there were a few orders before me it was almost twenty when I received it. 

Come check it out. If you see a few orders ahead of you and you don't have time, there are other great places in the food court especially Bangkok. If you have the time sit back as you are in for a very inexpensive gem treat that you will enjoy.","4 star rating"
"1666669668-4998","https://www.yelp.ca/search?find_desc=thai+food&find_loc=Montreal%2C+QC&start=60","Chang Lai","https://www.yelp.ca/biz/chang-lai-montr%C3%A9al?osq=thai+food","","What could have been a good looking, potentially tasty, and relatively cheap meal turned out to be worst chinese option at the Faubourg foodcourt. 

Prices are set at 6.99$ which is 8$ after taxes. It's still cheap, but quantity and quality don't measure up to others at the foodcourt. 

Allow me to justify the previous statement: Take a look at my photos and compare to those on the menu (other yelpers have posted them). We all know McDonald's photoshops pictures of their food, but the guys at Chang Lai probably stole theirs straight from the internet.

Indeed, the food tastes just as average as it looks: chunks of badly chopped celery, green pepper, and onion are stir fried in a wok. Throw in about 3oz of meat. Stir another 2min. Voila. 

The chicken was tender and tasted chicken, but didn't blend with the veggies (hard for chunks to release flavour in a 5min stir fry). And the supposed 'braised chicken' had not been braised, it was probably just coated in starch. Asked for spicy, got something that could have been 3x hotter.

The pork intestine has its chew and unique flavour, but the supporting flavours failed to blend in. Again, the spiciness level was underwhelming.

The only reason I'd go back would be when I'm in a pinch -- no waiting line and, as I mentioned above, it's a less than 5min stir fry.","3 star rating"

Best attribute is its cheap food - I got the beef countrystyle with white rice for c$6.99. Portion size was ok, generally to the small side. Beef was tasty and fresh. Another positive is that it is one of the few stalls that are open on Sunday (Indian Place and Yuki Ramen as well). If you're in the area and don't have a lot of money to spend and want some authentic Chinese food, go here. My order took a while because there was a few orders in front of me and there are literally 2 people (one cook) at this place","3 star rating"

Each dish is $6.99 plus tax and comes with a bowl of white rice. You order what you like and then the chef makes it fresh to order. They give you a choice of chicken, beef, or pork for some dishes. The food is comparable to what you'd get in a Chinese restaurant, seems to be super authentic, and is pretty tasty.  

If you're brave enough to try it, Ive heard that their intestine dish is extremely tasty as my friend comes back every week for it. Overall a nice place to grab a quick no frills lunch or dinner.","4 star rating"

They've recently reopened on the mezzanine level of the Faubourg Ste-Catherine after the strange closing down of the upper food court. (What ever happened to the Faubourg of old and why???)

Anyhow the food at Chang Lai is all good. But I'm especially taken by the braised pig intestines. Normally I can't handle pig intestines. In the past, the strong manure taste of them was simply too much for me. It took me a while to get up the courage to order them here. But lo and behold, this place has made me a believer in how good they can be once tripled cooked: first braised with five spices, then quickly boiled, then stir fried. Delicious and fun.","5 star rating"

They offered outside seating but we decided to go inside. Very nicely decorated with an asian ambiance.

This was my first time trying Thai cuisine so we wanted to taste a bit of everything. We ordered the Tapas Platter which included Salmon tartar, edamames, dumplings, mango salad, spring and imperial rolls and golden pockets. I loved the golden pockets and imperial rolls they were my favourite.  I don't-like mango but surprisingly enjoyed the mango salad.

We also shared a chicken pas Thai, which was good but enjoyed the platter more than the actual meal.

I live in SoCal so the price point here definitely took me by surprise. However, I really like the vibes and ambiance here.

Cost: I ordered the meal combo of $38. This included an appetizer, a side, the entrée, desert, and tea/coffee. For what was included, I think this is a fair price. My wife ordered the Pad See Ew which was $22. I'm not sure what's the common price for that order in Montréal and Laval nowadays, but I'm used to the $10 per serving in SoCal.

Food: I got the soup which is the sour flavor. It's not for everyone, but it's actually one of my favorites. The side was sliced mangoes and fried wontons. I think they were honestly just alright. For the entrée, I got the filet mignon which had a really great texture and was cooked just right. I love my meet cooked at medium rare and this was served to me with perfection. The barley rice was also a good touch. Desert was a pleasant surprise as it was matcha green tea crème brulée.

Service: Our server was really nice. He was very on top of things regardless of how busy things were. Thank you, Alexander!

Atmosphere: I like how the restaurant could help cater to a wide variety of clientele. You can go here for a family meal (given that the kids don't run wild), a romantic date, or just a fun night with friends.","5 star rating"

But not here.

The stuff is pre cooked and arrives already on the grill ready to be reheated.

You can't take some stuff out to pace your meal because there's no side plate.

The beef, the chicken, the mushrooms, everything is on the grill at once. No veggies, no onions. No choices. 

Why?! On top of this, they forgot to bring us a side. So no rice or anything.

I came here on a Friday night, and was seated and served pretty quickly. The place had some cute Asian decor but certain lighting (neon) and techno/house music did not match. While I ordered the chicken with peanut sauce and crispy spinach, my partner ordered the classic chicken pad thai along with a 10$ appetizer/sides of mango salad, 2 imperial rolls and 2 dumplings. The food arrived pretty quickly, the appetizer first then the main course right after. 

Although the small mango salad and dumplings were pretty good, but the imperial rolls lacked flavour and tasted like the frozen packaged rolls you can buy in Asian grocery stores. The best dish was the chicken with peanut sauce served with rice and crispy spinach, having a very generous portion and flavourful sauce. The chicken padthai was a fail, although it came in a big portion, the dish lacked Thai flavours and instead tasted somewhat a mixture of ketchup. 

I'm giving this visit 3 stars because the padthai was a fail, the ambiance of the restaurant was confusing and the price of certain dishes were not worth it. But on a good note, our service was quick and if you were to come visit, the chicken with peanut sauce is the best choice!","3 star rating"

As a vegan family it's hard to find good vegan food that would satisfy the entire family. Especially having a 9 yr and 12 yr old. Their eyes almost fell out of their socket when they tasted the food. In unison and excitement they said, 'oh my God this is sooooo good' I should have taken pictures of the food but it tastes phenomenal that I devoured it before the food can say, 'vegan cheese.' The wait staff was very attentive to our needs. As for some people complaining that the food takes too long is because high quality restaurant have real chefs that cooks from scratch. Most ordinary restaurants have pre-packaged food that takes seconds to microwave. All those big chains like Applebee's, Olive garden, Casey's all have pre-package food and not vegan friendly. If those chains have real chefs then they should be able to veganize the food but because it's pre-packaged they can't. The food at Sukho Thai is worth the wait. To top off out wonderful evening we found out that the chef was vegan as well. Would definitely dine here again!","5 star rating"

Once again love their decor and I think they added fish tank. The fish tank is a real beauty. So me and hubby ordered two drinks. I had their Sukho thai mango drink in coconut cup. Deliciously awesome, flavor and presentation, his tom yum martini disgustingly undrinkable. So we ended with another glass of wine. I had spicy tomyum soup that was Luke warm and salty but still pretty good. His coconut milk soup was also Luke warm but flavor was very good. Again like an idiot, I tried Amok steamed in banana leaf (it's my favorite Thai or Cambodian dish) hoping to find a different version from my favorite at la petite Mangue. My man ordered duck in five spices sauce. The duck came out really tough and seemed like it was frozen before. The sauce was really sweet like hoisin. The vegetable was whatever. It was just not good for a $33 entree. He was so excited about duck. My amok smelled way too fishy before the waitress even put it down on the table. I had four pieces of fish in there and the rest was just slimy onion and basil leaves. I think I'm giving up trying this this at any other Asian restaurant. The waiters were nice and friendly and the soups were good but I give up on Sukho thai. It's definitely not worth $100 something for two","3 star rating"

A real revelation that's been on my radar for some time. 
NB it is closed on Tuesdays :) as we once sadly found out.

This place is packed despite being quite large, prepare to wait during the evening. Takeout is a good option.

The nicely pictures menu, it is gigantic and leans heavily on beef and chicken. Going with people who've eaten there definitely helps.

We got duck, chicken, beef, shrimp, mussels, and even a veggie dish. The selection is truly astounding.

Quick breakdown of the meals, total with tax and tip is about $140 for 8 huge plates.

Awesome ""crispity"" sesame beef
Mussels in Thai Sauce
Won Ton Soup with shrimp
Hong Kong noodles with beef
Duck in Oyster Sauce
Morning Glory in garlic sauce
General Tao Chicken
Crispy Chicken

The top 3 were my faves, I love General Tao but this one was not as crispy and missing the spicy kick to complement the sweet.

The service is blazing fast, there's a huge waitstaff and lots of kitchen workers so not much chance to socialize as they're quite busy.

Overall would definitely go back and can finally give a quick answer if someone asks me if there's any good Asian spots outside downtown

A wonton soup was just a delightful way to start off, probably also the healthiest thing as well.","4 star rating"

Chinese food is what I grew up on. It's in many cases my comfort food. My dads side of the family is Chinese. It was part of the regular rotation of meals in my household and one of the few foods we would go out to a restaurant to eat back in he day. 

In my opinion Wing Phat is exceptional. We would eat some good Chinese restaurants in Western Canada and WF is as good of not better than the best places I can remember from my youth. Yes folks... it's that good! 

The first time I came here was on a weekend night. The front waiting area was around 10-15 deep with people waiting for tables. This also with the restaurant being medium large in size. They can accommodate large tables of say 8 or ten people at a time and because of the sheer volume can crank out lots of dishes in quick efficient manner. 

Here's what I have sampled here so far:

18- Imperial roll. Big in size but nothing special 3/5

25- Papaya salad (som tam)- spicy- 4.5 /5 lots of juicy dressing and great sweet/ tangy flavour

26 Grilled beef salad- generous servings of beef and served up quite spicy per normal. 4/5

142- Sesame beef- crispy and tender with that sweet sauce 5/5. Get in My mouth now. It's that delish

55- Hong Kong noodles with beef. In a beefy soya sauce mix.4/5

56- hong Kong noodles with beef and Chinese broccoli. 5/5 I liked this a bit better than 55. Crunchy gai lan and the beef is super tender as always 

48- crispy chicken- served dry with a bit of salt and sliced Chinese style. 3.5/5 not bad but I've had a bit better. Served with ubiquitous shrimp crackers 

103- morning glory pan fried in garlic- 6/5. If all vegetables tasted this good maybe I should be a vegetarian! 

118- Chicken Hamok (funny name en francais)- aka red curry chicken 7/5- so tender and that red curry sauce is on point with light heat. Also I love they don't skimp on chicken (like many other restaurants do) which I absolutely despise!  

Their menu is hella gargantuan huge. It has photos of the dishes which I wonder why more places don't do this? Great idea!  I can't wait to come here to same more and more! 

*****One minor downside that annoys me slightly is you can't pay with CC. Can't collect those CC rewards folks! Cash or interact only.","5 star rating"

A real revelation that's been on my radar for some time. 
NB it is closed on Tuesdays :) as we once sadly found out.

This place is packed despite being quite large, prepare to wait during the evening. Takeout is a good option.

The nicely pictures menu, it is gigantic and leans heavily on beef and chicken. Going with people who've eaten there definitely helps.

We got duck, chicken, beef, shrimp, mussels, and even a veggie dish. The selection is truly astounding.

Quick breakdown of the meals, total with tax and tip is about $140 for 8 huge plates.

Awesome ""crispity"" sesame beef
Mussels in Thai Sauce
Won Ton Soup with shrimp
Hong Kong noodles with beef
Duck in Oyster Sauce
Morning Glory in garlic sauce
General Tao Chicken
Crispy Chicken

The top 3 were my faves, I love General Tao but this one was not as crispy and missing the spicy kick to complement the sweet.

The service is blazing fast, there's a huge waitstaff and lots of kitchen workers so not much chance to socialize as they're quite busy.

Overall would definitely go back and can finally give a quick answer if someone asks me if there's any good Asian spots outside downtown

A wonton soup was just a delightful way to start off, probably also the healthiest thing as well.","4 star rating"

Chinese food is what I grew up on. It's in many cases my comfort food. My dads side of the family is Chinese. It was part of the regular rotation of meals in my household and one of the few foods we would go out to a restaurant to eat back in he day. 

In my opinion Wing Phat is exceptional. We would eat some good Chinese restaurants in Western Canada and WF is as good of not better than the best places I can remember from my youth. Yes folks... it's that good! 

The first time I came here was on a weekend night. The front waiting area was around 10-15 deep with people waiting for tables. This also with the restaurant being medium large in size. They can accommodate large tables of say 8 or ten people at a time and because of the sheer volume can crank out lots of dishes in quick efficient manner. 

Here's what I have sampled here so far:

18- Imperial roll. Big in size but nothing special 3/5

25- Papaya salad (som tam)- spicy- 4.5 /5 lots of juicy dressing and great sweet/ tangy flavour

26 Grilled beef salad- generous servings of beef and served up quite spicy per normal. 4/5

142- Sesame beef- crispy and tender with that sweet sauce 5/5. Get in My mouth now. It's that delish

55- Hong Kong noodles with beef. In a beefy soya sauce mix.4/5

56- hong Kong noodles with beef and Chinese broccoli. 5/5 I liked this a bit better than 55. Crunchy gai lan and the beef is super tender as always 

48- crispy chicken- served dry with a bit of salt and sliced Chinese style. 3.5/5 not bad but I've had a bit better. Served with ubiquitous shrimp crackers 

103- morning glory pan fried in garlic- 6/5. If all vegetables tasted this good maybe I should be a vegetarian! 

118- Chicken Hamok (funny name en francais)- aka red curry chicken 7/5- so tender and that red curry sauce is on point with light heat. Also I love they don't skimp on chicken (like many other restaurants do) which I absolutely despise!  

Their menu is hella gargantuan huge. It has photos of the dishes which I wonder why more places don't do this? Great idea!  I can't wait to come here to same more and more! 

*****One minor downside that annoys me slightly is you can't pay with CC. Can't collect those CC rewards folks! Cash or interact only.","5 star rating"

Super popular, so was excited to try. A bit divey and location not the greatest but. Food was  very good. Extensive menu.  We ordered Hong Kong noodles,  Chicken ginger,  Beef vegetables over crispy noodles,  and grilled chicken. Portions were a little off. Would like to have more chicken or beef instead of the extra large portions of rice. I think I got about 3 cups of rice with my chicken.  All very tasty. Another rhing..urgh..  Bring cash. They dont accept credit cards. If debit, it must be from a Canadian bank. Conveniently they have a cash machine which cost over 4 USD to get money out.

Wing Phat is a Vietnamese/Thai/Chinese restaurant that offers plenty of options from lobster to stir-fry vegetables. The best thing to order is the sour/spicy tofu soup. It's amazingly flavourful and is a huge portion which you can share with a group. Everything ordered from the crispy tofu to the stir-fry vegetables was absolutely perfect! 

 You're not going to get five-star quality service, but the staff is approachable and helpful. The service is quite fast so you won't have to wait too long for your food.

I'd marked this place a few months ago and today was the judgment day. We arrived around 7pm on a Sunday and the place was full, had to wait in line for about 15 minutes until seated. Good sign, good sign. 

We ordered Thai beef, large size Singapore noodles, General Tao, mixed vegetables with tofu and a medium bowl rice. Truly awesome, very delicious, professionally prepared dishes. 4 adults, we stuffed our faces and we had to ask for a doggy bag. The star dish was the Thai beef. I don't think I've ever had any Asian beef dish elsewhere with cotton like softness, melt in your mouth without the chewing struggle like a cat kinda beef. Mind blown :)

Don't expect much decoration wise on the inside nor have second thoughts entering the place while on the outside like I had. It might not look all that trendy, chic and inviting but once you had a few bites of them splendid food, these thoughts just disappear in thin air. Food quality/taste over looks anytime for me. Don't get me wrong, bathroom and the rest in general are clean. Yip, I'm that type of dude who knocks stars off if bathroom is missing TLC and or hygiene in other areas is neglected.

Wing Phat is a family friend authentic Asian restaurant with Vietnamese, Thai and Chinese cuisine. Their selection is amazing. There are many dishes familiar to the locals but many more of them discoveries from overseas that are fantastic. Looking around while sitting gives you a healthy mix of different ethnicity enjoying their food experience.

The first time I had the Sesame Beef was one of the best dishes I ever had. Their crispy chicken was amazing... simply decadent. Their morning glory veggie dish was a great foodie experience. We had a number of noodle dishes are they're all good. Nothing disappointed. Nothing. Excellent food, can't wait to go back with friends! Excellent for sharing. Menu has pictures, smart.

Service was good but slow the first time we went around 7-9PM. Line-up was about 30 minutes as they were incredibly busy, the second time we hit it early and we didn't even wait and the food we got was real quick. I smiled when I left seeing the 50+ people waiting to sit down.","5 star rating"

The Phnom Penh is a soup with noodles, seafood and minced porc( I usually ask for no organs). The soup base taste extremely flavourful and savoury. The Lok Lak is a dish served with marinated beef bites and a sort of orange fried rice. It is delicious and is humongous. They are so generous with their food portions... 

The entire restaurant is super clean, and the staff is nice. I love how the prices on their menu already includes taxes. I would recommend to try this restaurant if you love authentic Asian food.

I really enjoyed the food. The restaurant looks a little worn on the outside and does not have much curb appeal but I quickly got over that. Street parking was available as they do not have a parking lot. We went for dinner around 6:30. It was busy but we were seated quickly. The menu is huge. There are lots of Asian inspired dishes to pick from. We ordered spring rolls, shrimp wonton, General chicken with spicy fried rice and salt and pepper halibut. The food did not come out all at the same time but it was fast and hot. The taste of everything was very fresh and had great flavor. A tip: they don't take credit cards (why I gave them 4 stars), they take Canadian dollars, US dollars or you need to use their atm which had a crazy surcharge. If you pay with US dollars which we did be prepared to not get a very good exchange rate.","4 star rating"

Went there a few times with friends for dinner. Last time I went with 2 friends. First of all, this place has no parking spots but street parking can be found fairly easily. We went there on a weekday evening for dinner and were seated right away, with the most of the tables with customers already. 

As this place serves a mix of Cambodian, Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese food, I decided to go for the loc lac beef, which a meal consisting of cubes of beef accompanied with tomato sauce fried rice. The quantity was generous and the food itself was tasty. However, I did not feel that it was enough for the price that I paid.

I refrained from giving it a negative review the first few times thinking that maybe i was just unlucky and always went there on bad days. 

I ended up going back with a group of friends for someone's birthday a month later and we ordered a variety of dishes for the table to share. 
Among them were beef brocoli, ginger lobster and steemed tilapia. 

We asked the waitress if the seafood was fresh before ordering because we didn't notice aquariums with live seafood and she confirmed that all their seafood was fresh that they were just kept downstairs. We found it odd but decided to order seafood nonetheless. 

When our orders came we were all shocked at how small the lobsters were, like the poor things were caught before even reaching adulthood. We ate it anyway and it was one of the worst ginger lobsters i had ever eaten. 
It was overly sweet as if it was cooked in peanut butter and the taste of the ginger was non existant. 
The lobster meat was also very dry it felt like it was precooked the day before and then microwaved. 
We moved on and tackled the tilapia next and the meat was so bland everyone thought it tasted like a fish that was purchased frozen from a supermarket. 

By then everyone had lost their appetite and given up hope but we still forced ourselves to finish the beef brocoli. I was really curious to see if the beef was going to have that same powdery texture like meat that has been sitting in baking soda for too long to achieve tenderness and to my dismay it did! 
Something is just not right when the meat falls apart before you even begin to chew it.

This is actually really really good Chinese for the surprising location it's at. Another excellent perk is that everyone including the Asians on staff speak fluent English making it extremely easy to communicate any special requests needed. (and we all know I will have a few)

Let me start by saying this place really has their S*** together !!! I went on a super duper ridiculously busy Saturday night.. (the type when you walk in and there's a line up practically out the door, but then again it's almost always like this because it's that good) and still the wait was only about 10-15 minutes because this place is decently large with a lot of seating.

While I was waiting for a table, I asked the hostess what she suggested as vegan options (I had been there many times before as a vegetarian but first time as a vegan). She was very sweet and quickly suggested I start to take a look at the menu and walked me to talk to a manager on duty.

The manager took some time to go over a few dishes with me and sauce options for my noodles, even though she was overwhelmingly busy. She basically said to choose any dish, substitute any meat for sautéed tofu instead and that they would be able to make almost any sauce vegan with the exception of like 2 (the menu is so large with 100+ dishes). 

Yes, this was probably the most difficult order I've had to place because of the specific ingredients needed to make these type of dishes... but in the end it all worked out. It took my waitress a few times back and forth with the kitchen to really confirm what was in some dishes and if they could be made without a specific ingredient (some things are already pre-made like the milk in the curry sauce they use but other things like the fish sauce on veggies are usually freshly added so can just be easily made without). Thumbs up to the chefs. I may have had to repeat, ""no milk, no eggs, no fish sauce, no honey"".. quite a number of times... but everyone was super nice and accommodating.

Customer service is A+, food is A+, oh and I almost forgot to mention the portions are Large and very reasonably priced !!!!

From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look very...appealing. It appears to be small & run down. I went based on a recommendation from a friend and boy am I glad I listened! 

The interior of the restaurant is really nice and despite looking rather small from the outside, it's actually quite large and spacious! You don't feel crammed up (even during their busier times). The menu is HUGE (almost too big), which makes it so hard to decide! Each food item is properly described for those of us that are not familiar with Asian foods/terms. Their noodles are cooked to perfection & sauteed to the most flavorful ability. 
Bonus: tea is free with, unlimited...and yummy!

However...just be careful if you're the specific type (ie: if you ask for no egg, make sure there's no egg...requests aren't always paid attention to). Service is mostly friendly, but try not to take too long to decide what you want.","4 star rating"

This place was a letdown to me.
After being highly recommended to me, I decided to take my mom there for Mother's day.

The Good:
It's hip 
It's trendy 
It's clean
It's got a lot of options
They have big screen TV's with sports channels.
Free Wifi
They are relatively fast, despite being very busy. You won't have to wait very long for food to arrive.

The Bad:
-It's a bit expensive for what it is.
-Our waitress wasn't the greatest/friendliest
-We asked for Thai lobster. We were told that they don't have it...we needed to order regular lobster and needed to pay $4 extra to add Thai seasoning to it 
-The salt and pepper squid has thin shreds of squid surrounded by lots of batter.
-Normally, when you order soup, it should be served first (before the other dishes)...in our case, it was the last course to arrive (never seen this before in any restaurant anywhere...Italian, Colombian, Mexican, French, Chinese, Thai etc. included).
-I'm not sure if this is a milennial thing, as the entire staff is made up of college/university-aged workers, but I'll stick to my old-school Chinese restaurants where I can be guaranteed good food, good service, good prices, and my soup being served first (even if it doesn't come with the bells and whistles that this place offers).

I had the #5 Beef Shank Noodle Soup ($8.95).  It was slices of beef shank, bok choy and noodles.  There were green onions and cilantro as well.  

The broth was surprisingly good.  It was very flavourful and had a very subtle spicy kick to it.  It was not spicy, I mean I would consider it mild, but it had an ever so tiny and fleeting kick to it.

They pull the noodles in front of you when you order and then toss it in hot water.  It's a fun show to watch.  

The noodles were nice and chewy.  The bok choy were nicely cooked.  The beef was super tender, but since it was shank some pieces were a bit too fatty for my liking, but there were some lean pieces too.

Really depends on what u order. The pork ribs noodle is pretty descentbecause the meat is tender and flavorful.

Today i ordered the beef shank,and found it underwhelming, the beef didn't have much flavor to it, they should make a real hao lam meen instead.

The soup base is all the same,and taste more on the sweet side rather than meaty flavors. 

The noodles are descent as well,sometimes undercooked,so u have to soak it in your soup before eating it.

A good about the place is they only charge 1 dolla for double the amount of noodles,which is totally worth it  cause or else you won't be full from their regular portions.

Conclusion,better than nothin when you are really craving for some soup noodles.","3 star rating"

I have lunch here very often since the noodle here is better than that in other Chinese restaurants. I recommend the #2, that is my favorite one, noodle with pork sauce. That one is delicious that I can't find anything to substitute it.

They made the noodle in front of their costumers. Many Lanzhou-noodle restaurants doing it in China so I feel it is very common. However here is a non-Chinese guy makes noodle here, which makes me feel very interesting:)).

The broth was tasty and rich, the noodles were firm and fresh and the pork was delicious, with a genuine bbq roasted pork flavor. I'm sure that the Québécois who live here might not think much of this place, with so many great food options in this wonderful city, but for someone like me in the middle of the food desert that is central NJ, it was quite a treat to find such a quality bowl of noodles, just casually walking by in an underground mall.

The soup broth used to be richer and now it's watery a few times when I was there. The portion of noodles in the bowl seems to have decreased as well and now paying 10$ for a bowl isn't really enough for lunch as.

It's like watching a true pizza chef flipping the pizza.  

They only serve noodles here - hence the name.  So please don't ask them to substitute it for anything. :-). It's located on the 1st floor of the Eaton Centre.  

I had the BBQ beef shank noodle soup for $8.95.  The noodles were pretty good and there was ample beef shank.  Sometimes this is a problem with food court food in that give plenty of carbs and very little meat.  It's kind of the exact opposite here.  I kind of wanted more noodles, but I can't really complain since I got a show out of it and were made right in front of my eyes, literally!  

What I liked was that they put the soup in a separate bowl so that you could appreciate the noodles before pouring the broth on it, however I would have preferred if the broth was a bit hotter.  It was warm but I like my food piping hot.  Despite the broth not being to my liking temperature wise, when you combined it with the hand-pulled noodles, it made for an awesome light snack.

Verdict: Come see a quick show and a good light snack.  

To ponder: I hope they have more than one noodle puller during busy hours because it did take around 7-8 minutes for my meal to be prepared and that could end up in a huge line during the lunch rush.","4 star rating"

The food itself is OK.  I won't say its the best Chinese food, but it's definitely not the worst.  To all the people complaining here, I'd like to remind you that you are in a food court.  With that in mind, it is probably the best Chinese food court food I have ever had.  The food is quite flavorful, and the portion size is good for what you are paying (8-10 dollars a bowl).

The broth is not bad.  It has a bit of a kick to it and pairs well with the noodles.

The star here though are the noodles.  They are hand pulled in front of you and then put to boil in the water for a minute or two to firm up.  When you bite into them, they have a nice chew to them.  

I tend to order the noodles with pork sauce.  The pork is nicely seasoned and very chunky and sprinkled with some fresh cilantro. There are nice undertones of garlic and Chinese spices in the pork sauce.  You can think of it as a ""Chinese spaghetti bolognese"".  Since it is served as a dry noodle (no broth in the bowl), they give you a small bowl of broth on the side.  I pour a bit of the broth over the noodles to loosen them up, this making it easier to eat with the chop sticks.  This is my favorite bowl to order.

I've also tried the other dishes and they have all been consistently good.

I would definitely recommend this place if you're craving unique noodles downtown, and some good Chinese flavors.","4 star rating"

After a long day of shopping, I decided to give it a try. Normally food court food will be frozen and heated up or fast food that is filled with calories. Not with Nu-do. Each dish uses hand made noodles that is made fresh to order. 

During my visit, I ordered the noodle soup with chicken and my brother ordered the noodle soup with beef. The noodle soup with chicken tasted amazing. The noodles had a nice texture and were cooked amazingly. The broth also tasted delicious as it was filled with flavour. My brother said that the noodle soup with beef tasted awesome and the noodles were the best part of the dish.

The chef spins, stretches and slaps the dough on the counter. He then separates the dough into fresh noodle goodness. It certainly attracts a crowd!

You select from about 8 different options including, pork, beef chicken and vegetable. Portions are a decent size and priced between $7 - $9 per bowl.

This is probably the first time I tried freshly made Udon noodles and it really makes a difference. These are damn good noodles.

I ordered the vegetarian soup and it was served with Bok Choi, mushrooms and lot's of green onion. I thought the broth was slightly oily but still good overall. 

I will be back the next time I'm in Montreal to try some of the other options.

PS - If you sit near the restaurant, it gets very LOUD. The dough is slammed against the counter over and over again, it actually scared me a few times.

Located in the food court at the Eaton Center, it isn't the first place I'd think to get my soup fix, but it works.  They do takeout, putting the noodles and toppings in one container and the soup in another, so you don't need to sit in the food court to enjoy (though it can be fun to people watch). A bowl of bbq pork noodle soup will cost you less than $10, so it doesn't break the bank either. It isn't particularly spicy, yet it's flavorful, so when I need to get the sinuses moving I make sure to load up on the hot sauce to add in.  

As an added bonus, while waiting for your soup you get to be entertained by the cook pulling the noodles.  It can get loud, as the dough is repeatedly banged on the counter, but oh so worth it.","4 star rating"

Food: Obviously I ordered noodles since that's the only option on their menu. I chose the chicken with sesame sauce, but the non-soup version. The noodle puller, as I like to call him, emerged from the kitchen ready for some serious action. After giving me a rather serious 'don't mess with me' look, he proceed to yank the sh*t out of the noodles, then slammed the hell out of them. Repeatedly. It's a rather noisy and somewhat aggressive process and I can only hope that the noodle-puller achieved satisfaction from the physical exertion of the task. 

The non-soup was served in a to-go bowl, with the noodles on the bottom, shredded chicken and baby Bok Choy on the top, and of course, the sesame sauce. The first thing I tried was the chicken - it was all breast, just the way I like it, with not a hint of pink anywhere to be found. Though a little salty, I really enjoyed the chicken. It was tender and seemed fresh. I had to forgo the Bok Choy because no amount of cutting (or attempts at) seemed to work. I just couldn't chop through the damn leaves. They were so pretty and green, too. Anyway, I then got a taste of the noodles in sesame sauce. The sauce was  quite nice but tasted more like the peanut sauce you would find with peanut butter dumplings. The noodles were good though I did find them to be a bit on the starchy side. Also, they really should cut these things in half so I can get them on my fork more easily. The overall dish was very good, though I will hold that 4th star for a retry - this time in soup format, as the noodles are meant to be eaten.

Service: This is where I docked a star. The chick at the counter wasn't friendly at all and I felt like I was bothering her. Never mind that it was 2pm and there was no one else there. The noodle puller wasn't friendly either. It was one of those places that made me want to get my noodles and get the hell out of there, perhaps to a sunnier side of the food court.

Price: Under $10, and the noodles are pretty filling.","3 star rating"

As people before me have said, the big draw to this place was that they have hand-pulled noodles.  I really liked how their noodles were made to order; the noodle guy came out from around back to make the noodles as I finished ordering.  This guy was by no means an expert noodle-puller (an expert would've been much faster), but they were cooked just right (not too mushy and not undercooked), and the beef was also very well cooked.  The soup has gotten many compliments here, but it seemed pretty standard to me - however, I did like that it is less salty than most other places, so you can really pick out other flavours in the broth.

Portion size-wise, I thought it was a perfect size: just enough to make you feel satisfied without being overly full.

As others have also touched on, the only drawback was the wait.  I went on a Friday afternoon (about 1:30pm, so after the lunch rush), and still had to wait a bit before I could eat - on the one hand, it's understandable because it's made to order, but it's also in a food court, so you would expect a bit more expediency in the food prep.  After I had ordered, and before I got my food, there was a sizeable crowd of people also waiting...I can't imagine how they deal with an actual lunchtime crowd!

Price-wise, I paid a bit over $10 for a bowl of beef noodle soup.

Overall though, it's a good place to eat if you want something tasty, not super-filling, and have a bit of time to spare.","4 star rating"

We came during the lunch rush and ordered two rice bowls-- one spicy salmon and another General Taos. Both were good, but not particularly amazing. The restaurant is definitely geared more towards Westernized tastes, so if you're looking for something more authentic, I'd look elsewhere. 

SEATING
There's ample seating inside with a bar area. There is also a terrace outside with shade.

SERVICE
Our waiter was great. He explained to us how the restaurant worked and what dishes he recommended. We also had allergy concerns, which he was able to resolve right away. Once we placed our order, we received our meals within 10 minutes, which was absolutely amazing as we were starved.

LOCATION
You can't really beat the location. It's at the heart of downtown Montreal and nearby a plethora of shops, attractions, Metro stations, and the Places des Arts.

Overall, a decent place if you want something quick to eat in a nice setting, but nothing particularly unique, so I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out.","3 star rating"

It was required at the door, and some QRs later, we were comfortably seated in the quiet, airy dining room.

The menu was very straightforward, with several dishes from different parts of Asia: wontons, butter chicken, pad thai, etc. The resulting argument toward authenticity was rather unconvincing, but I'll write it off to the ""Fusion"" part of the restaurant label. I did, however, dislike certain things, such as the choice of dishes such as ""General Tao chicken"" as representative of Chinese cooking, or the label ""NO MSG ADDED"" printed in large letters onto the menu. I think a restaurant that supports the love of Asian cuisine might consider not feeding into the myth of the Chinese restaurant syndrome. 

We ordered from the lunch menu, which came with an entree and a main. The rythm and quality of the service was very pleasant. The wonton soup had some unusual ingredients (mushrooms...?), but was comforting and tasty. The imperial roll (lonely roll resting proudly besides a little mesclun leaf) was crispy and hot. I had the ""Singapour with shrimps"", which was rice vermicelli tossed with curry, curcuma and some quite roughly chopped, barely cooked vegetables. 

At the risk of falling into unfair rants, I will end the review by stating that as an ""Asian-inspired restaurant"", Sésame is likely doing a good job. The plating is elegant and beautiful, and the food is fresh and flavourful. But its meanderings into stereotypes of Asian cuisine could be aggrevating to a more purist crowd.","3 star rating"

Whenever I'm in a place like Montreal, I'm especially down to rock pho knowing it'll be better than my most of what is offered in my neck of the woods. (#1) Pho Tay Ho, a famous name in its own right, pays homage to the Tay Ho region of Hanoi, more specifically the West Lake (Ho Tay Lake).

I can't say this is the best pho in Montreal or even that it's semi-reminiscent of the Tay Ho massive. What I have enjoyed over the years is a halfway decent broth in a nice big bowl (xe lua) in a fairly serene setting (it's never too rowdy here), and a solid execution across a variety of classic Vietnamese dishes.

For folks not feeling the pho, I would recommend any of their bun (noodle) dishes and their rice (com). If one orders a bun thit nuong (pork chop), the portions are substantially enough to keep even the hungriest eaters at bay. Of course, I would recommend their appetizers of spring rolls (cha gio) and summer rolls (goi cuon).

The prices have always been right, the place is spacious to handle all sorts of groups, they always have a sparkling clean bathroom, and the customer service is friendly. If I haven't been thrilled about one thing it's the fact they close at 8:30pm, which I find to be prime dinner hours. I was always told that it's because pho typically runs out long before then.

A bowl of comforting Pho is the best remedies for hangover after bar hopping.

Bo Thai Chanh ($10) Rare Beef Salad was a huge serving which I enjoyed. House Special Pho ($10) was decent.

So nothing really stand out for a special visit but worth coming if you are in the neighbourhood and craving some solid Vietnamese food!

Pho Tay Ho can be super busy even on a week nights. But at least on a warm summer evening, the back patio is open for business.","3 star rating"

I've been meaning to give Pho Tay Ho a try so I met up with E on an early Wednesday evening and we were able to snag a seat on the terrasse right out front. 

Service is spotty as once we ordered and got our food, they never came back to check on us. 

I like that they have a sheet for you to mark your order. Keep it because you'll need it to pay after. Note: you can pay with debit.

- Bo tai chanh (#3) ($10.00) - interestingly, this rare beef salad comes with shrimp chips. Not the best that I've had; I would have liked a little more acidity and brightness to it. 
- Pho ga, long ga, tai (#15) ($10.00 large) - mix of gizzard, liver, heart of chicken and rare beef. Rarely order chicken pho but the broth was very clean tasting and lemongrass was at the forefront. 
- Pho tom voi rau (#20) ($10.00 large) - shrimp and vegetables. Broth was a little more sweeter but the shrimp was tasty (you only get four though).

I liked the mural outside of the establishment, it was beautiful. 
We sat in the back area kinda half inside the building and half outside. 
My gf ordered Bo tai chanh (which was actually good) it had a good portion of it, shared amongst 3 ppl. Which was plenty. 
The flavors reminded me of thai style. I loved the peanuts adding the nutty sweet flavor onto the beef. There was also an herb that made the rare beef tasted wonderful. The sauce it came with was sweet. So we added a bit more salty fish sauce along with 2 hot chilli peppers to add a kick into the dish. It was like exploding with flavors after all that. Remember to squeeze on the lime though.
Next we ordered the Pho dac biet and Pho tai chin.
They were small bowls... I remember ordering Beef... but the broth came out smelling like hardcore chicken noodle soup. It smelt like chicken, which reminds me of a gamey smell, i was not pleased with it. It smelled nothing like pho... felt like they catered to a diff crowd here. 
The Cooked beef was also off, tasted exactly like what it is, and there was no masking that flavor. 
The rare beef was normal. 
The pho overall was a disappointment. I would never go here again for pho .
As for my gf, she ordered a bun thit bo nuong. ThAt dish came out HUGE, big enuff to feed 3 ppl. 
It was good, the bun was well cooked (still moist and not stale)  and beef tasted well seasoned. 
The only complaint here is the damn sweet fish sauce. Its like they dumped the entire box of sugar in it. 
Calm down on the sugar sweethearts.

The cafe sua da , i usually like my coffee bitter (like more of an espresso) but this coffee had an awful taste. The condensed milk couldnt even help it taste any better. 

Yuck. 

The soy milk on the other hand was good, i liked the soy milk.

Overall im giving this place a 3/5","3 star rating"

This place is POPULAR with the locals.  Packed to the brim but lucky enough to grab a seat.  They serve an extensive and authentic Viet menu and boy was it good.  The summer rolls were really fresh and tasty.  Pho was flavorful (came in 3 different sizes), grilled pork chop was massive and decadent, and the grilled pork vermicelli was chock full of fresh veggies and herbs to take the meal to another level.  

Portion sizes are very large here.  Some other Yelpers thought it was a bit pricy but not me.  Well worth it for the quality.  This place is cash only but coming from NYC what else is new for a real Viet restaurant?  Two big thumbs up.","4 star rating"

There is a large dining area and a patio for al fresco dining.

We ordered two bowl of pho and one vermicelli dish. The pho was tasty, filled with plenty of beef and noodles and came with a healthy bunch of basil and plenty of bean sprouts.

The vermicelli was served on a huge platter with lots of grilled pork, 2 skewers of grilled shrimp and 2 spring rolls. There was soooo much fresh basil, mint, lettuce and bean sprouts on the side. Although we thought $15 seemed a lot for a vermicelli dish, they certainly didn't skimp on anything so we could see why it cost more than usual.

We also had an iced coffee with condensed milk. It tasted good, but there was very little condensed milk so it was quite strong and not really sweet enough (and we don't like it too sweet). 

Our son ordered a fresh lime juice with sugar and soda but they were out of soda, so they gave him 7up instead. The problem was that they still added the sugar to the lime juice, so the whole thing was way too sweet.

All in all, the meal was pretty good and we'd probably return.","3 star rating"

We ordered:

Appetizer: Beef tartar - this was good comes with onion, peanuts, and fried rice crackers to eat with beef
pho - this was not very good. Soup was a bit bland.
Vermincelli with shrimp shewers and pork chop - this was much better than the pho. It also comes with a good amount of mint, bean sprouds, asian basel.

I am not usually a person to slam a restaurant unless it's really warrented. This was warrented. Food is more a 3 star, the spring rolls and the fresh rolls were very good. They offer Med-Xlarge pho size. Good flavor, harty and good price.

Now, let's talk about service because that is a huge part of the experience. To be fair, I will admit, my friend is a bit demanding, but whether it's culturally acceptable or not, we tip generously and are not rude about our needs. I also need to understand maybe it's just a Canadian ""thing"" to be not very personable. I don't know, but to me, customer service is customer service! With that being said, our waiter was RUDE and his rude sarcasm was not appreciated and I LOVE sarcasm. He was quick to judge us as Americans. After ordering additional spring rolls, he ignored us and we never received them. He snubbed us the whole time and avoided eye contact. We asked for tea and he said there was none and then brought us a pot. WTF, that was not confusing at all. He could not get us out fast enough.

The dish I pretty much always get here is number twenty something, it comes with these homemade ground pork rolls and noodles and broth and veggies and it's just an insane mountain of incredibly flavourful delicate wonderful food. I take home the leftovers and eat it for like 3 days, and I cheat on my vegetarian-ness here when I crave it and I ain't even sorry about it. You have to follow your heart, man, you know? 

I find the service here totally great, and very Vietnamese. They aren't all fake smily with you but they are super professional, and will crack you up and slide you a sweet grin if you're paying attention. 

This is one of the best and beloved Vietnamese places in the city so if you come at peak times you'll find a line. I recommend mid-afternoon on a weekday. Relax and enjoy.","5 star rating"

We also got the beef salad, it was quite special. Kind of like beef tartar but got a Vietnamese spin to it with loads of peanuts and fresh herbs. Great!

Ordered two pho Dac biet and shrimp rolls. Nothing fancy but always comforting. Food came pretty fast too. Big portion, the broth do taste different from the ones in toronto, doesn't have as much flavoring, not as complex?? but still good. The tendons are very chewy, as if they were undercooked air dried tendon, we could not bite through them at all. The beef were very fatty, they weren't sliced very thinly, somehow I enjoyed the fat lol. The meal was very good overall, we were too cold and tired, we felt great afterward.

The service here was great, fast and attentive staff. One other thing I was very impressed was how clean their utensil were. The steel tea pot was shiny and spot less, not even any water mark on it. I thought it was only that single one we got. When we were paying at the front, I saw a whole stack of teapot and cups just as clean and shiny as they ones we got. They deserve an award for that!

I went with a friend who eats here a lot and served as my 'menu guide'. He talked me into sharing a first course dish of raw beef with lemon, onions and peanuts that was served with a fish sauce on the side. Fan-frigging-tastic! scooping it with shrimp crispies kinda reminded me of really fresh mexican nachos (with an Asian twist to it). It was a big dish, and we didn't even finish it before our mains arrived.  By my friend recommendation I took the L size soup.  It turned out to be way too much, together with the first course... but I  loved it. I got the beef pho with everything (raw beef, flank beef, beef balls with a weird condensed texture, some sort of intestines that were too chowie for by taste). Of course there were noodles and green onions in the broth (which was good), as well as extra sprouts and holly basil on the side. Very satisfying dish. I'm glad I had it and that I got to try different types of beef additions to my soup - to find out what I like a lot and what's not really for me.

The broth tastes very authentic and the banh pho (pho noodles) are the wide type which is uncommon in most places. Being a Vietnamese person I am very picky regarding pho and I will have to say this place gets two thumbs up. Very clean inside and fast service. The ordering process is a little odd but easy. You get a menu and also a sheet to order on. Write the quantity down and someone will pick it up and put in the order. We also got the bo thai Chanh (beef salad - raw) and it is phenomenal. Lots of fresh limes, peanuts and onions. So fresh. If we find ourself in Montreal again we will make a trip here.","4 star rating"

It was packed full but we were seated (party of four) i about 5 minutes. Unfortunately I was disappointed by almost everything: the beef pho broth really lacked in flavour, there were barely any noodles and way too much beef. My boyfriend got a chicken and beef pho (with chicken broth) which lacked even more in flavour and tasted as though it had been watered down. The grilled chicken dish was HUGE, so that was cool, but the chicken didn't taste that great. As well, the service wasn't the best, not very attentive and not super chaleureux. I did, however, really like the imperial rolls, those were delicious. Will not come back to this place again.","2 star rating"

They were pretty loud talking amongst themselves and as we were trying to pay, it felt like no one wanted to get up and ring us out. The place is away from the touristy places but the prices I find was still a bit high. $3.00 for ONE goi cuon? I thought that roll better be amazing, but it wasn't (scroll through pic from other yelpers). We've had really good authentic pho before, but the broth for this place was bland.

I'll start off with the few things that were good: their bun cha + the fact that things were reasonably priced, especially an XL bowl for $11 

Still, the servers were pretty rude, and we were wholly dissatisfied with the pho. The broth was bland and not an authentic pho broth (that's usually rich in flavor from beef bones).

When I come to this place I always order the pho ga long ga which is chicken pho with chicken innards. It might sound repulsive at first but please do give it a try because you might end up ordering it every time like me. What I absolutely love about the pho here is that they have small pieces of lemongrass which is a pleasant surprise every time you happen to bite into it. Furthermore, the pho noodles are so fresh and they feel like silk when you slurp your soup.

If you like to sunbath a little I'd recommend getting a table towards the back of the restaurant as there are huge windows there.

I almost forgot to mention that although the service is not the best, the orders come out quicker than a blink of an eye. Once an order of pho is placed, you get your bowl within 5 minutes. That's like fast food level of speed!","5 star rating"

Their broth is fragrant -- it is not watery or overly salty.  Delicate bits of fat sit on the surface of their soup, decorated with fresh herbs and a decent helping of round eye.   Their noodles are neither overcooked or undercooked.  Basil, lime, and bean sprout sit on a separate plate in generous portions and are very fresh.  I haven't encountered a dried out lime here yet, which is one of my pho grudges. 

Seating is abundant -- there is atrium seating as well as patio seating in both the front and the back for sunnier days and their service is wonderful.  Come, eat here.   This is a good bowl of soup.  I often come here when it is swelteringly hot outside and that's only because it's too hard to say no.","4 star rating"

Checked my Yelp app and noticed this place saved in my Bookmark selection. Walked in and about 30 patrons were inside. I was the only non-Asian in the place. Excellent. I'm at the right place for some quality Vietnamese.

Walking in, the place looks somewhat simplistic with a terrace on both sides available if it weren't fall or winter. The ambiance was nice.

I went with the Tay Ho 'Special BBQ' dish (Bun Cha Tay Ho) and it came back 10 minutes later. It was excellent. The soup was amazing, the meats hit the spot and the side order was mighty tasty. And the price tag was ridiculous for this kind of quality. I immediately felt jealous for people able to walk/order from this place on a daily basis.

On my way out, I took some Vegetarian Pho home for the wife and even with the winter tip home, she has never had Pho this good.

Might've just been an off day, but I'd advise against ordering fresh pork spring roll; I've had gum less chewy than the rice-paper wrapper they had stretched around it.

Again, solid pho. I got the works, and there was the better part of a cow in my bowl. None of this postage-stamp-sized-slice-of-tripe and half-blob-of-tendon.

I went with the usual Dac Biet Pho in an XL bowl.  I had trouble finishing it.  There isn't just shreds or cheap thin slices of beef, this is a legitimate proportional bowl of noodles.  X doesn't mean bigger bowl, more soup--- it means more of everything!  and gosh there was at pound of meat in my bowl (ok maybe half, but you get the gist).  It was all fresh quality ingredients and maybe one of the best pho I've had in North America.

The spring rolls were ok.  The meatball was not as dense as I would have liked but the flavors were there.  I guess the Pho is what you need to lean on here.  I love it.","5 star rating"

With all the Vietnamese restaurants I've tried in Montreal, a majority of them usually suck in comparison to Vietnam, and this sucks just as much too.

The food was also a real let down. I had the Pho Tai, but as a Vietnamese person, this has to be some of the worst Pho I've ever had. The broth was flavorless and full of MSG. They gave very little meat, and didn't even have the little dishes to dip it into hoisin/Sriracha.

Great flavors and there was a good amount of rare steak.  The Bun Hoac com bo nuong was okay. The noodles were abundant and cooked well; while the beef tasted delicious, it was a bit too chewy at times.  Now, I thought the pho was delicious. However, it did not remind me of pho. It reminded me of chicken noodle soup, like Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup. This is good but it is not what I'm expecting when I order beef pho. It tasted like they used a chicken broth and added beef. Their rare steak, well done beef flanks, and meatballs were also good. There was only 1-2 quarter slices of meatballs though, but the flank was abundant and had fatty ends to it that were cooked perfectly.

I have been coming here for years. Back in the day, a bowl of Pho was around 5$, prices have gone up quite a bit since, but you can still get a good meal here with a drink for less than 20$ taxes and tips included, which is still a huge deal!!!

The Pho really shine here, both the Chicken and Tai Nam variety. My tip for you is: ASK THEM TO PUT KAFIR LIME LEAVES IN YOUR PHO, no matter which option you pick. The lime leaves will bring out a new dimension to all the flavors... trust me just try it :) (I'm vietnamese and grew up eating this stuff). 

For me, this is the best Pho in town, it is consistently good. Pho is a very fussy thing to make well consistently, if you ever go to a pho place regularly you will notice sometimes the taste is off. For this place though when it's off it's still good, and when it's on, there's just no better.

This place is famous for the Tay Ho special bbq dish,  (Bun cha Tay Ho), it comes with different types of grilled meats soaked in fish sauce, vermicelli and a heap of herbs, mix everything in a bowl and eat, the fun part is to mix different herbs each time, add some fish sauce and voila!!!

Another signature dish is the ""Cha ca"" dish, it's grilled tumeric spiced fish on a hot plate, served with vermicelli and a heap of fried onions and dill. This one you eat with a shrimp paste sauce. The flavors in this dish is very pungent, definitely an acquired taste, be mindful if you want to try. But those who like shrimp paste, you will like this dish.

Try also the iced coffee, viet style, yum.","5 star rating"

We tried to sit twice at two different tables, but we were redirected until we got to one specific table (they should've taken us to the table if that was such a problem). Then, we looked at the menu and made our choices. Several waiters passed by our table without noticing we were ready to order, even though we had our order sheet on the edge of the table and we were trying to make eye contact with them. Eventually, one waiter came, took the order sheet, glanced at it, looked at us with contempt, and just said ""we don't do only drinks and desserts, you need to order a meal"". Told him we had already eaten somewhere else, but he didn't care and just left with the menus. It didn't make any sense since the restaurant was empty.

Summer roll had chicken and shrimp in it and I would have preferred no chicken (but that's just personal preference). The summer roll was very fresh and tasty. Didn't taste pre-made (i.e. the rice paper was very sticky and fresh).

The reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the fish sauce was way too sugary. I usually pour all of the fish sauce into the bowl but this time I couldn't finish the bowl because the sauce just overpowered everything with a sweet taste. However, compared to other places I've been, the quality and taste of the meat, veggies, and overall taste of the bowl (excluding the fish sauce) was very, very good. I would definitely come back and also recommend this place.

Bun Bo Nuong Cha Gio - Grilled lemongrass beef, spring rolls, vermicelli noodles, pickled carrot, vegetables, piles of Thai basil, mint leaves & cilantro, crushed roasted peanuts and nuoc mam(fish sauce), all were barely fit for the bowl! Smoky and sweet flavor, I LIKE!  This restaurant is generous with its portions: piles of thick cut grilled beef was very satisfying with a bunch of - literally a bunch! - cilantro, Thai basil, and mint. I'm sure you will love it too if a herb lover like me.

Pho Dac Biet - Pho with rare and cooked beef, beef balls, tendons and tripe. Thai basil, sprouts, and two little Thai chili peppers crushed by my big spoon, into my soup; OMG it was one wonderful meal! Not the best broth compared to Pho Lien, but the rice noodles had unusual great texture; lots of basil & mint leaves & hot chili peppers are given to tables; the portion of meat was just enough; and most of all the place was nice and clean, plus recently renovated along with new tables and chairs! 9.5/10 LOL!","4 star rating"

As a California native my standard is pretty high but since NYC doesn't have pho that hits the right spot. I get my dose at Pho Tay Ho whenever I come up.

I come to Pho Tay Ho every weekend for ""brunch"". In my opinion, this is the best pho place in Montreal. It is often busy but the service is great and the food comes out quickly as well.

Every week, I order their special pho. Recently, they decided that they will no longer include tendons/tripes in their special pho which was a bit of a let down (hence the 4-star). Also they decided to exclude one of my favourite old items - the sour pork spring roll - since it wasn't a popular menu item. I have been having their fresh spring roll with shrimp and chicken instead which is also fantastic. 

Regardless of their recent menu changes, the food here keeps me coming back.","4 star rating"

This place is just...whoa. Firstly, the tables are really nice. They look like they are made of marble (Are they? I didn't bother checking. Someone find out for me please) and there is a terrace in the front AND at the back. What?? This is a Vietnamese restaurant? Usually the atmosphere is more low key, nothing extraordinary, and very simple. 

The service is good and one thing I should mention is the portion size of the food is quite unbelievably large for a Vietnamese place, especially the bun cha gio. My friend goes there often and she told me the portion sizes here are large, and boy she was not lying. The salad was good a chunk of the plate, the imperial rolls and vermicelli took up half of the plate and so on. I ordered a modest medium pho ga,..they gave me so much meat...I was very happy. 

The highlight of this restaurant, is that they have bo tai chanh which is Vietnamese beef carpaccio. This is rare because most Vietnamese restaurants do not offer this dish. Portion size, again, quite large and came with many shrimp chips and underneath big pieces of lettuce.

The breadth and depth of the stock is what sets Tay Ho apart. It's meaty and marrowy, with no trace of the false kick of MSG that so often mars that of other establishments.

The specialty of the house is the Chicken Pho (Pho Ga) and it actually is pretty darn special here.  I had all but given up ordering the chicken variety in most places as I end up with bowls of bullion buffeted by blanched bleached bundles of chicken meat formerly known as dark.

We initially wanted to try some of the famous pho restaurants in the chinatown area but were referred to pho tay ho by a banh mi shop owner. it's a little pho shop out of downtown but it was well worth the drive.

The pho ga (chicken) broth is excellent. It rivals the best pho in toronto and albeit pricey compared to toronto pho, the bowl is steaming hot, generous portions of onions and cilantro, the meat is fresh, and the portions mighty.  It leaves such a lasting impression that sometimes I think another bowl would be worth the 8-hour trek to montreal.","5 star rating"

What makes it special? The fact that the cow rolled over the chicken that crossed the road that ended up in my bowl of noodle soup. Slices of raw beef flank topped the bowl that featured pieces of chicken both large and small. To make this order of Pho Ga double special, was the fact that I got the one chicken gizzard, liver and heart. I know what you're thinking, ""how can one bowl of noodle soup contain so much awesome without exploding singing hot soup all over your tshirt"". Subsequent soup spatter did however end up on my shirt - that's only because I'm clumsy. The added offal added a rich and deeper flavour to the soup - it's not for everyone, just the ridiculously good-looking.

Pho Tay Ho has been at this location for as long as I can remember, and as long as I can remember, the food has always tasted the same. Consistency doesn't seem to an issue for them as their formula for deliciousness cannot go wrong. Not only do they specialize in chicken pho, but subsequently all things chicken, various chicken dishes on the menu can be found. You can disagree, but like I said before, Pho is the ultimate blitz, there are so many variations that each place will surely be different from another and that's something I can guarantee.

The broth was flavorful and the chicken meat was pretty good, almost tasted like free range chicken.

The good surprise for me was the Goi Ga` ( chicken salad). Unlike many places that mixed their Goi Ga with too much sugar and cabbage, Tay Ho mixed their Goi Ga just like the way people in VietNam normally do. A little onion, a little salt and peper, little sugar, a little lemon juice, peanut, and a decent amount of rau ram (which has a lemon and coriander-cilantro aroma). Their Goi Ga is something you gotta try if you visit this restaurant.

Highly recommend this place for Pho Ga and Goi Ga.

On the side note, this place does not have parking at all and it's a pain to find parking on the street.","4 star rating"

Between two reasonably hungry adults (and one not-so-hungry toddler), we still had a serving of leftovers to take home with us. Friendly service, if a bit cursory (mainly involving rushing by to grab your order sheet and confirm that you've chosen what you think you've chosen).

I always get the Pho Dac Biet, this soup has all kinds of meats under one bowl. The soup is delicious and you dont get all thirsty from the MSG (in some other Vietnamese places)

Their Pho Ga is good and they also have Chicken Pho with Raw beef for those who do not know what to take.

You know how you can tell a Vietnamese restaurant is good when you see real Vietnamese people eating there? Well they certainly eat here.

Their Pork on Vermicelli is very tender and one of the best cooked meats in montreal. The pork chop on the other hand does not taste the same.

The drinks looked delicious and fruity and were pretty inexpensive at $8 Canadian. I had the safari, and it was fruity, as was expected.

The chicken and beef were served on a large platter with the Ethiopian spongey crepes and a little fresh salad in the middle. 

I liked the chicken a lot more than the beef, it fell off the bone and the sauce was excellent. All the dishes come with the crepes, and maybe they don't eat rice in Ethiopia, but I wish there was a different kind of starch... 

The service was excellent except for the little mishap when the waiter accidentally spilled water on me. Also, the tables are really close together, so I had to stand up and get out of my chair a few times to let the customers at the adjacent table get in and out....

On a Saturday evening, it can get very busy, so if possible, call ahead and reserve to make sure you have a seat.

Nil Bleu is a restaurant that can cater to vegan/vegetarians and omnivores (like me). With tons of choices to choose from, such as a chicken, beef, lamb, veggies, lentils, etc, you're bound to find something you will love.

We had the tasting menu for 2 with a mix of vegan and meat options so we could have best of both worlds. I kid you not, we were blown away with the portion and with the taste. The most fun part of our meal was to eat with our hands!

Together we have sampled some incredible dishes from LA, DC, Pittsburgh, Boston, and now, Montreal. 

Le Nil Bleu had the best vegetarian platter I've ever tasted. There wasn't a whole lot of variety, but the dishes they included were thoughtfully curated to fit my taste: stewed collard greens, yellow split peas, lentils, and sweet cabbage and potato. Everything was seasoned to perfection and the house made injera further emphasized the scratch made quality of the dishes. 

If you are concerned about sharing food while eating with your hands, there is no double dipping here because everything is pre portioned out for two. They did offer to bring us more injera, but we refused it. My favorite part is peeling the bottom layer that the food sits upon. The spongy, porous flat bread soaks up all that yummy spicy goodness. It's a huge bonus.","5 star rating"

I dont think being in Montreal it will ever be the real deal, especially when servicing Western palates.

The decor is very charming, with African themed art on display throughout the restaurant. 
The food was well plated and everything tasted delicious. The sampling dish for two, although a bit pricy, is a good choice as it allows you to try a variety of stews and injera as appetizers and main courses. 
The service was quite slow and there was only one waitress, but that might have something to do with the fact that we were there late on a Tuesday evening.

We had all had Ethiopian food before, so we knew what to expect; savoury curries eaten with spongy bread.

Paul ordered an ""Ethiopian Sunrise"" juice, a mix of four exotic nectars, and his dad got a house cocktail. Both were exactly what you'd expect, nothing extraordinary but certainly tasty. At the waiter's suggestion, we ordered the tasting platter for two, but increased for 3 people. We got the vegan appetizers and the vegan main course, but subbed the spinach for the fish dish to appease the meat eaters. The appetizers were quite good. In the middle there was a red cabbage leaf stuffed with a spicy eggplant mash and covered in a soft hummus. On one side was a sweet carrot stir fry, and on the other was a boring tomato salad. We polished this off quickly, and honestly I was already getting pretty full at this point.
Our table was cleared, and (sadly) our spoons were taken away, leaving us no option but to use the injera to eat the main course. I like injera, but I didn't want to waste my precious stomach space on sour squishy bread.
The main course was unispired. Two of the vegan options were the same, a red lentil stew, which was ok but really boring. Paul said it was his favourite, and still agrees it was boring. There was a split-pea stew as well, and honestly I felt the peas were undercooked, having that woody bean texture. The potato carrot thing was okay, well cooked and flavoured. There was a saucy mixed veg stir fry, which I thought was ok. The fish, according to the boys, tasted like absolutely nothing, and the sauce was bland enough to be overpowered by the injera. In the middle there was a completely out of place vinaigrette salad with lettuce, shredded carrots and cabbage, and pickled beets? It really felt awkward. We managed to eat 80% of the meal before the bread got the better of us. The waiter came around offering dessert, but we just couldn't fit it.
The tasting platter comes with a mead, and it was pleasant, much sweeter and ""honey-er"" tasting than many I've had before.

Overall we were disappointed in the restaurant. The price was painfully high for the quantity and quality of the food (they are serving me lentils.... that shit costs 0.02$). Despite what other reviewers are saying, there was 0 spiceyness in any of the dishes we received, with the mild eggplant being the absolute hottest item. We've had Ethiopian before, and this really felt like the watered-down, unflavoured white version. If you're hoping this is a good way to get a taste of authentic Ethiopian food, you would be misled.

Also, the decor is hella tacky. (Zebra print chairs and wallpaper, painting of ""tribal"" women, a staircase waterfall?????)","3 star rating"

We ordered the veg appetizer, meat and veg platter along with homemade cakes. The platter was a good way for us to try everything. My absolute favourite was the lamb in berebere sauce. I wasn't a huge fan of the other 5 options on the Injera. The Injera was everywhere, but absolutely amazing. The platter is also a hands on experience - no utensils needed. We also ordered a few of their variety desserts. I got the dark chocolate cake - on a stick. I wasn't a fan. Not sweet, with mild chocolate taste. I also ordered the Honey Wine.

Our waiter was amazing. He was playing host, and waiting on 11 tables and doing an excellent job.

I left a big tip simply for the great job the guy did managing it all. 

The food was pretty good. I had a curried beef with some sides. The food wasn't the best I've had, though I did enjoy it, the soup and tea were excellent though. The presentation was also unique, as you'll see from my picture.

Didnt opt for the 80 dollar chocolate fountain meal, didnt seem like a fair trade...so we were seated in a cold basement, packed in along with other diners...pretty much every customer was seated downstairs while upstairs was virtually vacant. Everyone seemed to find it pretty funny, even the wait staff. I get the sense that they dont respect the management or the restaurant itself, I can understand why....the food came out luke warm and frankly was underspiced, the worst ethiopian food ive ever had.

The music was god-awful, cheezy and weird. At some point a saxophone rendition of Star Light Star Bright came on.

The place is pretty cold, pretty weird, trying for a modern chic thing with pictures of Eithiopia and the desert on the wall, bit of a disconnect. While other Eithopian restaurants Ive been too have been relatively warm and inspired, Nil Bleu seems like a weird gaudy lab.","1 star rating"

It was a wonderful treat. The place itself was lovely, very clean and inviting. The service was excellent. The food was out of this world. We had the tasters choice which involved selecting from a vegan menu and a meat menu. We selected vegan for appetizers and meat for main course, as I was concerned about eating a steak tartar which was in the appetizer selection.

The presentation was very inviting and all of the food was delicious. I was very happy with the tasters choice as it gave us an opportunity to try a cross section of selections. I was not disappointed and my husband was as happy as I with the restaurant and our selections.

For a cocktail, I ordered a cosmopolitan with the caveat that it not be too sweet. It was the best cosmopolitan ever. I really appreciated the bar tenders honoring my request, and I was rewarded with a delicious well balanced cocktail, not too sweet, not too tart, just right.

Ever since that incident, I have come here two more times and the last time, they just tested my patience.  I came in asking for Shuro Wat.  The lady suggested the vegetarian platter to me.  I asked if I could substitute one of their platter items for Shuro since that's what I came for.  The lady said yes and went in.  Ten minutes later, the platter comes out without the Shuro.  I politely tell her that they got the order wrong and that I asked for a Shuro substitution.  She took the plate back to the kitchen only to bring the same plate back 5 minutes later saying there is nothing they could do about it.  I believe Shuro cannot be ordered as part of the combo since it takes a while to cook.  I understand that because I make Shuro at home but this should have been communicated to me.  Now, they literally give me something that I never asked for in the first place.  I thought maybe I would get a discount on the bill.  No, nothing.  How shameful can it get?  When I complained about this to the manager (who only met me much later), she said oh well, just don't tip your server then!

The food was incredible. We had the vegan tasting menu and it was truly delicious. I loved all of the appetizers and the mains, but the eggplant appetizer and the greens in the main were especially amazing. The injera was fluffy and sour, the way it should be. I also tried one of the micro-brewed beers on the menu and it was great. The only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5 star review is that, given the ingredients used (lentils, split peas, veggies), it is quite pricey. $30 per person before tax/tip/drinks is a lot when every other Ethiopian restaurant I've been to (and I've tried many!) has charged around $10-$15 while serving a similar amount of food. It's true that the quality at Nil Bleu is top notch, as was the service and ambiance, but it's hard to want to pay double what you would elsewhere for very similar food.

This place is located on a pleasant, easily accessible street. Parking isn't difficult to find. The decor of this place is stunning: a modern interpretation of authentic Ethiopian ambiance. The walls are covered with paintings depicting rural Ethiopia and many chairs are covered with a zebra-patterned fabric. We were greeted after a short wait until we were told that our table (that we had reserved a few hours back) was not ready. Instead of apologizing, they sat us down in the hotel sitting room next door which was cramped. We sat there in silence for 10 minutes until a waitress came over with water. While this was a nice gesture, it was inappropriate that we waited for 20 minutes after our reserved time. And then when we were seated, they placed us downstairs, right next to the bathroom... Anyway, the service was progressively better as the night went on. The menu is quite interesting, but I would recommend the traditional family platters over individual entrees. We began with the vegan appetizer, which consisted of chickpea puree with eggplant, garlic and lemon dip, tomato salad, and an amazing eggplant dish. Everything was served with injera, or soft, sponge-like bread. This was fantastic; I'm not a fan of tartar, so this was perfect. The eggplant was so juicy and filling, while the dips were extraordinary. We then got the meat entree, which had at least 6-7 different dishes on it. According to the website, the meat plate consists of ""Yatakelt watt : cabbage, potatoes and carrots sauteed Yebeg Key Watt: Moist Lamb cooked in berbere sauce Gommen : Spinach with onion and garlic Doro Watt : Chicken with berbéré sauce Bedergan : Zucchini in our special alicha sauce Zilzil Tibbs : Filet mignon strips sauteed with ginger Digestives: Tejje, Traditional digestive made out of Honey."" Every meat entree had its own unique flavor. The lamb was absolutely incredible, served in a somewhat spicy, herb-infused sauce. The chicken was fantastic as well. Their sides were surprisingly as good as the meat. And once you finished all of the meat, more injera. Everything, except for the service, was absolutely amazing, so I definitely recommend this place if you don't come on a busy Saturday evening.","4 star rating"

If you like food from India and Tibet, you should try this place! For dessert they have little cakes, I tried 2 that were just okay; not sure if in the future I'll get any. You can eat with utensils or your hands - but trust me, once you get the hang of it, hands make the whole experience even more interesting!

So late that the waitress had gone off. Never mind, the hotel receptionist filled in, with excellent, attentive service.
The meal took 30 minutes to arrive, it is not fast food. It tastes like well made, with love, yummy food with rich varied tastes and textures.
I had the vegan sampler--so good, spinach, lentils, split peas and a cabbage/potato/carrots mix. Each with a different flavor profile. Husband had chicken with hard boiled egg and a nice salad. Well-seasoned and impossible for him to describe the flavors beyond--never had anything like that before, and excellent.","4 star rating"

I'm a huge fan of Ethiopian food. The food here wasn't particularly spicy, even the food that the waiter said would be spicy. But what it lacked in heat, it made up for in taste. The meat dishes were terrific but the real stand outs were the veggie dishes. The caramelized veggies (okra, eggplant, onions) was so good. The chick pea dish (what the waiter called Ethiopian humus) was sublime. Even the injera tasted better than most I've had.

We ordered a tasting platter (meat option) which gives you a chance to sample a bit of everything and is definitely worth it if it's your first time trying Ethiopian.  It's $30 a head but it does give you appetizers and a variety of main dishes to try so it is worth the money.  

Traditionally Ethiopian food is eaten with your hands using a flat bread called ingera, which I might have spelled wrong.  If you would rather use utensils you can ask for them.  The bread doesn't taste like much but that's a good thing since you end up tasting the actual dishes more which are seasoned with a variety of spices.  My only real issue was that some of the options which were supposed to be spicy didn't live up to the hype but overall I really liked however I really liked how the food tasted.  The meat was very tender in all cases and the sauces that the food came in were very good.","4 star rating"

The decor is very loungey and made for groups and sharing, which I particularly liked. It made me want to come back with a whole group of friends.

The service was a little slow to start with, but very friendly, and we didn't hang around for our food. I had a sort of caviar of aubergines, which was very tasty, followed by the lamb in berberé sauce, which was mildly spicy and extremely tasty. The ""bread"" with which you eat your food is a type of pancake, slightly thicker than a crepe. For dessert, they offer an assortment of little cakes on sticks. I believe the one I tasted was chocolate with a lime and ginger filling.

Everything is served on a big plate in the centre of the table. I am not sure if they separate meat and vegan options. If you have a vegan friend, this is the perfect place to bring them, because half the menu is vegan.

As mentioned, pricing is very reasonable, and I'll definitely be back soon.","4 star rating"

My mom had been wanting to go for awhile so a group of four of us went for Mother's Day lunch.
We ordered the tasting menu which I would highly recommend. You get a selection of several different appetizers followed by a selection of different entrees. 
The appetizers were all delicious, but their Steak Tartare was just amazing! The main meals were all very flavourful as well. I liked all of the meals, but my favourite entree was probably the dish with strips of filet mignon. The fact that you eat with your fingers and share a large plate make it a much more enjoyable experience.  

They had a fun selection of fairly priced fruit cocktails - the one I got was vodka, coconut, peach, and pineapple - and a long wine list.

I really enjoyed the decor and atmosphere. It was Sunday afternoon and not very busy, so it was nice and quiet. The restaurant had an African theme and was aesthetically pleasing.

This place is elegant, classy, and charming. I read that the service was terribly slow and expected just that, but it was friendly, helpful, and quick instead. None of us really knew what would be best to order, so our server suggested we get a plate that is not on the menu that provides about 80% of authentic Ethiopian food. It gave us the chance to taste majority of the flavours and satisfy our curiosity!

First they brought out a vegetarian plate that had 3 items - spicy diced tomatoes, an interesting spin on hummus with eggplant, and sauteed mixed vegetables. It's presentation was remarkable, it tasted phenomenal, and was a great start to this foodieventure.

Then they brought out a large silver tray with portions of lamb, filet mignon, beef, and chicken. In between these portions were other vegetarian options like spinach tossed with onions, lentils, salad, and a pea-puree. Everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection. 

Absolutely. Everything. Promise.

Now, what makes this one-hell-of-an-experience is the rolled up pancake looking bread that you use to pick up all these rich flavours. You eat every bite with your hands and really get in to it with no shame. 

I paired my meal with a glass (or 3) of their Shiraz and was pleasantly satisfied with how it complimented the meal perfectly.","5 star rating"

Already there, I was impressed, even though that restaurant was a little dingy inside. Imagine my surprise on seeing how nice Nil Bleu was inside and then how flavourful the food was! It's too bad they aren't BYOW anymore (they used to be), but it's a great experience with friends. The sour ethiopian bread they serve the food on and which you use as an eating utensil is wonderful! 

What's great about this place, and their food, is that they have combo plates you can get for the table. This way, everyone can try a little bit of everything. Each different dish is wonderful, really complex flavour profiles, spices, marinades and a lot of stewed meats and lentils. The only downside is the DJ and the sometimes loud and obnoxious music. Other than that, this is a great bet for an interesting date night, or for dinner with friends. I agree with the other reviewers that you should try to sit outside if you can. Oh and make sure everyone WASHES THEIR HANDS before eating :)","4 star rating"

They are really trying too hard in some trivial respects and then not hard enough when it comes to the important things ... like the food! The ambiance is nice; perhaps a bit overdone. The service is affable enough. But, alas, the food ... if they worried a little less about the decor and instead emphasised their focus more on the authenticity of their food then I'd be much more satisfied. I really could care less about ambiance. I don't go to a restaurant for the atmosphere. I don't go to a restaurant for the service or to complain to the waitstaff. That's just not how I roll. I go for the food! The delicious and life sustaining food. Notwithstanding the African and black and white zebra-print theme that this place has going on ... the food as I mentioned is anything but authentic. It's just uninspired.   Maybe it's just me but I must have ... I want ... I need to taste the heat and the spices of Ethiopia when I eat Ethiopian cuisine. This place is not that. I think that this resto purposefully caters to patrons who require a more bland and tasteless flavour profile. So if you want a watered down version of pseudo-Ethiopian food then this is probably your jam. However, if you want delicious and hearty and oh so fulfilling Ethiopian cuisine please do hightail it on over to East Africa Restaurant on Sherbrooke Street West in the heart of NDG and everything delicious will be yours to enjoy. Good luck!","1 star rating"

My wife, who is visibly pregnant and has our 1yo daughter with her goes to pick it up, after waiting 40 minutes, she is starving, they refuse to give her the order because she didn't have the card on her. This is a totally normal thing, to authorize a charge without the actual card, restaurants always do this, but this asshole manager, who I could only assume is sexist, refuses to give her our dinner. They rather let it go to waste and lose regular customers. The guy apparently thought that we were trying to scam them.

We went on a Saturday night for dinner, and were late due to lack of parking anywhere near the restaurant (only street parking available, and not much of it). The entrance to the restaurant was cramped, with a large coat rack in the way.

Decor was nice as well as the ambiance. There was a live pianist which was a nice touch. Since it was our first time, the waiter took the time to explain the concept of the menu and how we should go about eating our food. We ordered a hummus plate to start, which was delicious, but way too much hummus in comparison to ""Ingera"" (the spongy crepes used to pick up your food). I ordered the vegetarian platter, and my date got a spicy beef dish. The food came all together on a large platter with an accompanying garden salad and more ingera. Price-wise, the vegetarian platter was very reasonable ($17 for 4 dishes) whereas the beef dish alone was $14. The chickpea and lentil dishes were both good, but lacked in spice. The mixed veggies and the spinach were also a little bland, nothing special. Overall the dishes were alright, BUT after a while, I became nauseated at the texture of the ingera. It reminded me of a sponge and had a slight vinegar aftertaste which did not sit well with me. I would have probably enjoyed the food more had it been served with some other kind of starch.

I've had good memories in this Ethiopian restaurant and is in fact one of my fave places. I highly recommend the combo meal which includes chicken and other meat dishes (lamb, beef), curried lentils and peas, stew, etc. You can order vegetarian to meat dishes in one combo meal. The meal comes in one huge dish lined with a large flat bread topped with your chosen dishes. You'll be given a set of rolled flat bread and you have to eat with your hands - like break off a piece of flat bread and dip it into the dish. It is really fun especially if you are sharing the meal with your friends and makes for a social and communal dinner! The meals are flavorful (lots of herbs and spices) and the bread tastes good. The waiter will give you more flat bread upon request. i don't know if the dishes are really authentic but i just love the combo meal because it's a great way to have fun while eating, just watch your friends make a mess out of eating with their hands. Make sure you don't drop some of the sauce on your shirt, the curry will definitely leave a yellow stain.  

They have  some African decor and just renovated the place and the toilets were an absolute surprise. You have to see or use them to know what I mean. It is better if you make reservations and be prepared to wait more than 15 minutes for the food to arrive. The price can be moderate to expensive (more than 15-25$ per person). If you share the combo meal with your friends, I guess it's reasonable.","4 star rating"

Despite not having a reservation, we were able to sit at the bar on the main floor without a wait. They have a variety of Thai and Asian inspired dishes which is exactly what we needed. Our server was prompt and took our orders once we were ready. I had the Tom Yum soup bowl with shrimp. It was a huge amount of soup and definitely enough for people to share. The broth was flavorful, creamy with a bit spice. The soup had an ample amount of vegetables, (bamboo sprouts, peppers, basil) and thin rice noodles to complement the broth. I would have liked a bit more spice but overall it was a very good version of tom yum. I wish I could recreate this broth at home! They have a great drink selection menu with fun cocktails, wines and beers as well. 

The pad thai was also was a good size with lots of sprouts and peanuts in a lighter sauce. Overall, ambience, service, location and food quality were all excellent. If looking for a place in the downtown with Thai cuisine this is a good option.","4 star rating"

The tofu was unfortunately diced slightly too large & lacked in seasoning, but that was quickly fixed by adding soy sauce. Besides the tofu, both dishes were amazing. 

Unfortunately our server at this location was so rude, i've never had a dinner experience like this one; it really ruined our dinner. Our appetizers came in after our main course. He would not check up on us for the first half & the second half he would take away our plates without asking if we were done. Plates that still had food in them... Brought out the bills without letting us know the restaurant was closing, we only found out while asking him. Left while other tables were still full.

They have a table d'hôtel lunch menu at a pretty reasonable price in terms of their location. 

I got the green salad entree and the tofu pad Thai. The green salad had minimal dressing and seemed to be quite a healthy option. It tasted fresh and the portion was great.

The pad Thai (requested it spicy) was good. The dish was not mixed with chilli flakes but rather red hot Thai chillies, making it taste more fresh and spicier (definitely a plus!). As for the tofu, I didn't care much for it. They seemed to be fried and so they were more on the oily side. Needless to say, I didn't end up finishing the tofu. However, the dish was large enough for a lunch meal. 

The service was great. The staff handled our party of roughly 9 people really well and were very attentive and friendly. The downside of this restaurant is that I didn't find they use enough  seasoning. I found the dishes lacking in flavour.","3 star rating"

I wish my mom had figured out this trick when I was a kid, I would have eaten way more veggies instead of slipping them to the dog under the table. This dish was really tasty with a light panco breading that trapped all the moisture of the marinade in, really a must try!

We recently stopped in on a Friday night without a reservation and were quickly seated at a narrow bar top in the middle of the restaurant. The small menu didn't have many mains that my wife would eat so we ordered a few apps and some sparkling Spanish wine. In addition to the aforementioned Fried Broccoli, we had Imperial Rolls, Crispy Shrimp Boa and Crab Boa sandwiches. The Boa bun was prepared with squid ink which of course turned it black without imparting any flavor that I could pick up so it made for a visually interesting prep. The Crispy Shrimp Boa was the best of the bunch (crunchy, sweet and spicy) while the Crab Boa came in last due to the messy and somewhat bland sauce. Overall I thought the apps were good but could have used a little more kick.

Total tab including tax and tip was about $150 which seemed a little high for what was on the plate. This place has a great ambiance and is worth checking out, we will likely return for another round of apps!","3 star rating"

So table for one please!

I skimmed through the menu (even though I did this already online)  I had ask the server if she had to pick between the beef salad or the pad Thai but she didn't seem to want to engage nor really gave me anything to go off with.  I ended up with the imperial pork rolls and pad thai.

I ended up waiting over 35 mins for the appetizer and I think she might have forgotten because my server came and ask if I got my rolls.  And even after that, it still took a few.  That put me off a bit.

The imperial rolls were on point, I wish I had some more veggies and bigger lettuce to wrap but they were perfectly fried and seasoned well with the right ratio for ingredients.  I was surprised by how good it was and wanted more.

The pad Thai came a bit after and it was beautifully plated.  However, my first bite, I already knew this wasn't the typical pad Thai.  Pad Thai has a sweet tang to it but this was so heavily garlic and salted that I had to consistently ask for water.  Mind you, it was delicious lol! I just would have called this a garlic noodle instead like garlic lover noodles.  The shrimps were lightly panko? fried and I ate every piece first before anything  else.  I was saddened by the amount of pork that I got.  I counted literally only 4 pieces and they were halves.  The noodles weren't cooked thoroughly so I had some undercooked rice noodles.  However, it was still a pretty decent noodle dish

For the price, I expected a bit more but it wasn't a bad experience.  I really like the rolls and I did enjoy the pad Thai even though I had different expectations of it","4 star rating"

Everybody knows that some of the restaurants in the Old Port area can be overpriced tourist traps. Never have I been so happy that I was wrong, definitely a fan of Hà and their food.

First of all, their space is very unpretentious and relaxed. It is decorated with little accents reminiscent of traditional Vietnamese decor. Charming details from the wallpaper to the use of bamboo/wicker accessories serve to elevate the space. Their terrace is also an excellent option and grab a seat if it is ever free.

So here's what we ordered: Crispy broccoli, vegetarian rolls, tofu baos and papaya salad. Everything was fresh and delicious. Don't go looking for an authentic viet meal by any means but you definitely won't be disappointed. Value wise, it is slightly overpriced for Vietnamese food but it could be worse.

Few month ago, I tried Hà mt royal (3 times) for diner and today I tried the one located on Old port for lunch. 

The menu is the same in both locations. But, the buns are not available for lunch.

I went with a special person, my mom:)
We both ordered the soup coco and we both loved it. The flavor of coco and spices  makes that soup exotic. It is a must to start lunch with it, in summer or winter.
Vegetable Spring rolls are crunchy and the papaya salad is fresh.
Their coco salmon is available for lunch and diner and i would highly recommend it in addition to the yummy shrimp & pork Pad Thai. I noticed that both dishes were revised in the old port restaurant.

Finally, we had both deserts proposed on the lunch menu, the small tapioca and the green tea ice cream. These were the perfect ending for this lunch.

Lets not forget to mention the service that was really fast despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded on this Wednesday afternoon.","4 star rating"

Despite not having a reservation, we were able to sit at the bar on the main floor without a wait. They have a variety of Thai and Asian inspired dishes which is exactly what we needed. Our server was prompt and took our orders once we were ready. I had the Tom Yum soup bowl with shrimp. It was a huge amount of soup and definitely enough for people to share. The broth was flavorful, creamy with a bit spice. The soup had an ample amount of vegetables, (bamboo sprouts, peppers, basil) and thin rice noodles to complement the broth. I would have liked a bit more spice but overall it was a very good version of tom yum. I wish I could recreate this broth at home! They have a great drink selection menu with fun cocktails, wines and beers as well. 

The pad thai was also was a good size with lots of sprouts and peanuts in a lighter sauce. Overall, ambience, service, location and food quality were all excellent. If looking for a place in the downtown with Thai cuisine this is a good option.","4 star rating"

I had the coconut salmon dish wish was incredibly well balanced in flavours & texture. My friend had the vegetarian pad thai with tofu. We also shared a bowl of edamame which was nicely done. The tofu was unfortunately diced slightly too large & lacked in seasoning, but that was quickly fixed by adding soy sauce. Besides the tofu, both dishes were amazing. 

Unfortunately our server at this location was so rude, i've never had a dinner experience like this one; it really ruined our dinner. Our appetizers came in after our main course. He would not check up on us for the first half & the second half he would take away our plates without asking if we were done. Plates that still had food in them... Brought out the bills without letting us know the restaurant was closing, we only found out while asking him. Left while other tables were still full. 

The lady at the door & other servers were very polite. Unfortunately the server we got paired with was impolite & lacked in restaurant manners.","3 star rating"

They have a table d'hôtel lunch menu at a pretty reasonable price in terms of their location. 

I got the green salad entree and the tofu pad Thai. The green salad had minimal dressing and seemed to be quite a healthy option. It tasted fresh and the portion was great.

The pad Thai (requested it spicy) was good. The dish was not mixed with chilli flakes but rather red hot Thai chillies, making it taste more fresh and spicier (definitely a plus!). As for the tofu, I didn't care much for it. They seemed to be fried and so they were more on the oily side. Needless to say, I didn't end up finishing the tofu. However, the dish was large enough for a lunch meal. 

The service was great. The staff handled our party of roughly 9 people really well and were very attentive and friendly. The downside of this restaurant is that I didn't find they use enough  seasoning. I found the dishes lacking in flavour.","3 star rating"

The location was quite charming. Service was great and my meal was great. I had the papaya salad and shrimp pad Thai. Unfortunately, I had major food poisoning after I left the restaurant. I have a pretty good stomach so this never happens to me. 

I wrote a Facebook message to the the restaurant but unfortunately they never had the courtesy to respond.

I wish my mom had figured out this trick when I was a kid, I would have eaten way more veggies instead of slipping them to the dog under the table. This dish was really tasty with a light panco breading that trapped all the moisture of the marinade in, really a must try!

We recently stopped in on a Friday night without a reservation and were quickly seated at a narrow bar top in the middle of the restaurant. The small menu didn't have many mains that my wife would eat so we ordered a few apps and some sparkling Spanish wine. In addition to the aforementioned Fried Broccoli, we had Imperial Rolls, Crispy Shrimp Boa and Crab Boa sandwiches. The Boa bun was prepared with squid ink which of course turned it black without imparting any flavor that I could pick up so it made for a visually interesting prep. The Crispy Shrimp Boa was the best of the bunch (crunchy, sweet and spicy) while the Crab Boa came in last due to the messy and somewhat bland sauce. Overall I thought the apps were good but could have used a little more kick.

Total tab including tax and tip was about $150 which seemed a little high for what was on the plate. This place has a great ambiance and is worth checking out, we will likely return for another round of apps!","3 star rating"

So table for one please!

I skimmed through the menu (even though I did this already online)  I had ask the server if she had to pick between the beef salad or the pad Thai but she didn't seem to want to engage nor really gave me anything to go off with.  I ended up with the imperial pork rolls and pad thai.

I ended up waiting over 35 mins for the appetizer and I think she might have forgotten because my server came and ask if I got my rolls.  And even after that, it still took a few.  That put me off a bit.

The imperial rolls were on point, I wish I had some more veggies and bigger lettuce to wrap but they were perfectly fried and seasoned well with the right ratio for ingredients.  I was surprised by how good it was and wanted more.

The pad Thai came a bit after and it was beautifully plated.  However, my first bite, I already knew this wasn't the typical pad Thai.  Pad Thai has a sweet tang to it but this was so heavily garlic and salted that I had to consistently ask for water.  Mind you, it was delicious lol! I just would have called this a garlic noodle instead like garlic lover noodles.  The shrimps were lightly panko? fried and I ate every piece first before anything  else.  I was saddened by the amount of pork that I got.  I counted literally only 4 pieces and they were halves.  The noodles weren't cooked thoroughly so I had some undercooked rice noodles.  However, it was still a pretty decent noodle dish

For the price, I expected a bit more but it wasn't a bad experience.  I really like the rolls and I did enjoy the pad Thai even though I had different expectations of it","4 star rating"

Everybody knows that some of the restaurants in the Old Port area can be overpriced tourist traps. Never have I been so happy that I was wrong, definitely a fan of Hà and their food.

First of all, their space is very unpretentious and relaxed. It is decorated with little accents reminiscent of traditional Vietnamese decor. Charming details from the wallpaper to the use of bamboo/wicker accessories serve to elevate the space. Their terrace is also an excellent option and grab a seat if it is ever free.

So here's what we ordered: Crispy broccoli, vegetarian rolls, tofu baos and papaya salad. Everything was fresh and delicious. Don't go looking for an authentic viet meal by any means but you definitely won't be disappointed. Value wise, it is slightly overpriced for Vietnamese food but it could be worse.

To avoid confusion, if you reserve online it's for the mont royal location. So make sure you google Hà on William and then the address and phone number will appear so that you can call and reserve ahead time. You will definitely need to reserve because it can get quite busy. I came here with my aunt yesterday night (Saturday) at 7:15pm and we stayed till 10 pm. At first the restaurant was half empty but by eight pm or so it was packed and we were seated at the bar because all the tables were reserved. Luckily I like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders and watch them make drinks.

I tried their Bloody Caesar which has sake in it. It was very good and spicy. FYI I told the bartender that I like it spicy. Afterwards I couldn't pick which cocktail I wanted and the bartender told me he would create one. So he made me a spicy drink that consisted of a rum, pastis, a splash of Earl grey, lime juice and a red chili pepper. It was surprisingly good considering  I don't like the taste of black liquorice and that is what pastis tastes like. I guess he didn't put much. He said it was to counteract the sweetness of the rum. These bartenders know what they are doing!

My aunt and I shared the papaya salad and the pork buns. The buns come in twos so it's perfect to share with another person. I was surprised that the bun was black because I'm used to seeing white buns. The bartender said it's because they use squid ink to make it black. I feel like they should put that on the menu because most people like squid ink. The dough was good and soft. I just wish they had more pork in it because it was a lot of dough. I prefer the pork buns from Satay Brothers.

For mains we shared the pork and shrimp pad Thai and the classic coconut salmon. The pad Thai was quite big and it had about four big shrimps in it. The salmon was good too and so tasty. If you like coconut I recommend it. These plates are meant for sharing so go and try a few things.","3 star rating"

I got the pandan mojito and it was exactly what i wanted. I got hints of kalamansi that reminded me of my hometown in the Philippines. Love the drink.

For food, i got the large pho bowl and beef pad thai. It was a heavenly, hearty meal and i swear they didnt pay me to say that. Ive had my share of pad thai and pho from new york and they dont come close to the quality and the quantity.

Crowded during the lunch hour but empties after 1pm. Outdoor and indoor seating. The prices are high here--$17 for the beef Pho. The broth is decent, but not the richest I've had by far. They also don't serve it in a customizable fashion. There was just a couple basil leaves in mine and far more bean sprouts than I would add. No lemon to squeeze in. The noodles were also non standard rice noodles-- they were flat and about the thickness of fettuccini.

I had the Shrimp stir fried noodles and an order of the the shrimp dumplings.   The shrimp noodles were good, soft noodles stirred with a good portion of shrimp and baby bok choy; the noodles were a bit soft and the dish could have been seasoned a bit more.   The dumplings were very good, with great flavor and an excellent texture to the dumpling wrapper.

We ordered two types of dumplings--Har Kao steamed shrimp dumplings, which were soft and delicious, and pan fried pork dumplings, which had a tasty tender meat filling. (They also came with a great sauce!)

We also had two noodle dishes--the first, stir-fried handmade noodles with vegetables, was delicious! They were very soft, and the vegetables were also great. There was a perfect amount of sauce in the dish, which we noted as restaurant noodle dishes often have too much sauce.

The stir-fried rice noodles with beef were also good; my mom said they reminded her of noodles from Malaysia. The onions were a bit raw, but the dish was still quite good. If you're only getting one noodle dish, though, I would recommend the handmade noodles.

While they don't accept card payments, they did accept USD (although at a 1.1 USD to CAD exchange rate rather than the going 1.3). Even with this higher rate, the prices were very reasonable, and we walked away feeling like we had had a filling, tasty meal at a good price. We all thought it was nice that each of the dishes had a unique flavor.

tl;dr: great place for handmade noodles & dumplings; they don't accept cards but take USD (and even with the exchange rate premium + tip, it's a bargain)","4 star rating"

(And yes, I have become a connoisseur of shrimp fried rice and sweet and sour fish)

The place has lots more interesting and more real Chinese food like dumplings and dim sum which I would have liked to try

Portion size is good for the price.  No credit cards are accepted, but taxes are included in the price.

Highlights: I ordered the beef chow ho fun, which is one of my favorite noodle dishes ($9.95 CAD, tax included).  The dish has beef, green onions, flat rice noodles cut into bite size pieces, and bean sprouts.  This dish tends to be greasy, but I was happy that my order from here was not too greasy.  There was a decent amount of beef.  The server politely served me water, even though I was ordering takeout.  Flavor profile was very good.

Critiques: None really.  Beef rice noodles aren't a fancy dish, so what I ate pretty much met my expectations.

Overall: Noodle Factory satisfied my noodle craving.  The dish I ordered was flavorful, not excessively greasy, and had a decent mix of ingredients that weren't noodles.  Plus, you get good value for the price.","5 star rating"

However, the food and service here will astound you. 
I went here with my father for lunch today and we were in a rush. We were led to a table and the menus were given right away. I quickly ordered spring onion pancakes as an appetizer and their stir fried handmade noodles with vegetables. The food was ready in five minutes, tops, but was still fresh and delicious. Their handmade noodles (that's why it's called the Noodle Factory!) are very tender and soft. They have rather low prices for generous portions of authentic Chinese food. 
I definitely recommend this cozy restaurant for a quick, cheap, and delicious meal!","5 star rating"

PAN FRIED PORK DUMPLING - The STAR dish of this restaurant here! Excellent flavor with a thick fried skin. Pair that with a sweet dumpling sauce and it's such a cheap dish for a meal.

Onion Pancake - I think the menu had called it a crepe and it's not your typical scallion pancake you're used to. They almost look like crepes stacked and fried on top of each other so you get a nice thick crunch biting into them.

Pork Soup Dumplings #13 - aka Xiao Long Bao (not formally called that on their menu). Unfortunately I have to compare coming from NY where there's places that out perform this quality. You get 9 pieces but they're small and not filled with enough soup as I'm used to. They stick together in the steam container and the skin is thin. When you try to peel a piece it ends up ripping the skin and spilling the soup out. Overall it's very picky of me, but the flavor of the pork is still there at least.

Service is super friendly too. Well worth a visit and don't forget, CASH ONLY!","4 star rating"

The 3 restaurants we randomly dropped into while walking down Chinatown: Restaurant Noodle Factory, Restaurant Pain Farci, and Qing Hua. We only ordered their juicy pork dumplings at each place.

Restaurant Noodle Factory -  4 stars. The 6 dumplings weren't very juicy but they were tasty and I really enjoyed their sweet dipping sauce. Worth the $10 price tag. 

Restaurant Pain Farci -  4 stars. The dumplings here were super soupy, flavorful, and ginormous, hence the $13/$14 price tag for 10 pieces.

Qing Hua =  1 star. The worst dumplings we've ever tasted...unless you like tons of extra hard dough with your dry dumplings. I would caution anyone from going there. Boo! Thumbs down

I myself is part Chinese & my bf is full Chinese. I love sharing my culture & our food. My boyfriend & I travel a lot and we love to check out the Chinatowns at all the places we go to, especially him. We saw the good reviews this place got so we decided to check it out. Noodle soup after a long day of walking & exploring Montreal on a cold winter day sounds like a great ideas right?! I regret it. But let me give some pros & cons. 

Pros: We got seated right away & it was a busy Friday night. The service was so so. Nothing to brag about. The food came out quick and hot. The prices are very cheap. 

Cons: Cash only. For a place called ""Noodle factory"" one would think there will be a LARGE selection of different noodle entrees to choose from. NOT. They have a handful but it's more of like corner Chinese store selections. I couldn't decide what I wanted because the menu didn't really intrigue me so I went with the classic wonton noodle soup. You can't mess up with that right? WRONG. Typically, wonton noodle soup contains egg noodles, a thin yellow noodle. The menu didn't specify so I asked the waiter can I have it with egg noddles. He quickly gave me an attitude as if he was upset or something and pointed to the menu and told me to pick one of their other noddles. I didn't want to make a scene so I told them I'll take it as it, however they make them. My bf order their spicy pork & vegetable handmade noodles. As soon as they brought out my wonton noodle soup, I was already disappointed. The bowel did not look appeasing at all. First, there were shredded cabbage in the soup. NEVER have I had it with that. Traditionally there's bok choy & green scallions & this bowl didn't have neither of that. The noodles was probably their hand noodles which was a thicker white noddle. Both the noodle & shredded cabbage was over cooked. The broth was flavorless, actually tasted like shredded cabbage. The wontons looked liked tiny amount of pork was quickly shoved into the wonton sheets & they didn't care if the meat fell out or not. There was already barely meat to begin with. Same goes for my bf's bowel. The noddle soup was so bland, we had to force ourselves to even try to eat half of it because we didn't want to waste food. I'm pretty sure they can tell we didn't really enjoy our food because after we paid, they felt the need to come to our table & remind us to leave tip on the table. We literally just got up to put our coats on, not even a full minute took place yet. As nasty as I may review a place, I ALWAYS LEAVE TIP. Heck, I work for tips myself at a nail salon. So for a place to be like that, it made my experience even worse. So after this terrible experience, we actually went to go eat Ramen noodle at another location outside of Chinatown & it was AMAZING!","1 star rating"

This place was fast, relatively inexpensive, and pretty good.

I got the Shrimp Dumplings (#3) and the Xiao Long Bao (Pork Dumplings #13) for lunch which was $11 and change. My food was ready in a little over 5 minutes. Both dumplings were good, my only complaint was that the skin was a little bit on the thicker side on both of them. The filling in both of them were flavorful. On the pork dumplings, there was not much soup inside them (I'm used to more broth / soup inside).

This place first caught my attention only because of the lunchtime queue waiting to get in. 

The noodles are very tasty. There is a wide variety, either fried or in hot soup. I especially recommend the ""zhajiang"" noodle. They are infused with a certain home-cooked goodness. Apart from the noodles, you can choose stir fried dishes and a selection of dumplings. 

Perhaps what is most pleasant is the excellent service we got. The two servers we had were polite, cheery and prompt. Food was served up very fast.

I noticed the restaurant was filled with Caucasian customers which I unfortunately didn't notice until I was already seated - made me feel like the place was not popular with Asian people who have tougher standards with this type of cuisine. Come on, you all know it's true.
*Steamed Chinese dumplings: Much to my joy the waiter confirmed that these are ""Xiao long bao"" (soup dumplings). There isn't much broth in it but they're loaded with very flavourful meat. Not the best soup dumplings I've had but they're loaded with meat which made me happy.
*Wonton (pork) noodle soup: Decent effort at this classic Cantonese dish. I only tried a spoonful of broth and it was light yet savory at the same time, and didn't taste too much like canned broth. Another member of my table had this and I didn't try any but he said it was good.
*Noodles with spicy vegetables & pork: The least impressive dish of the bunch - nothing ""spicy"" about this and the sauce was not salty enough for my liking.
*Pork & spicy vegetables noodle soup (with handmade noodle): Nice chewy texture of the  handmade noodles. Broth is nicely flavored with less spice than I would have liked.
Friendly service otherwise, and it looks like they charged no tax (but are cash only - you get what you pay for). Keep in mind, not only am I Asian, I grew up on Toronto - so with that experience in mind I feel this place is not amazing but it is okay.","3 star rating"

the stir fried handmade noodles would make us come back again and again if we lived in Montreal. the veggie steamed dumplings and wonton noodle soup would not. the steamed dumplings lacked something and it wasn't because it was a veggie and lacked pork or shrimp. we've had great veggie dumplings before and this wasn't the best. the noodles in the wonton soup were good, it was fresh and al dente, as well as the pork wonton which had a very petally wrapper,... but the broth had no flavor of onions, chicken broth, white pepper,... nothing. 

below avg or average soup broth requires a dip into the spice tray (chili oil, white pepper, etc...), but a great broth its great on its own. the good thing i didn't have to wait too long to have a second shot at the greatest broth on earth, it just wasn't in the noodle factory.","3 star rating"

What I liked about the food here was that it wasn't overly salty or oily.  Despite the fact that we probably ate a little too much, we didn't leave feeling weighed down by grease and fillers.  Our stomachs would agree that we filled them with delicious and fresh food.  Oh, and the staff is very helpful here.  One person, maybe the owner (?) was especially eager to tell us where to find the foods that Montreal was known for.  Too bad we spoke with him too late, on the last evening of our visit.  We will definitely make it a point to return to this restaurant when we are in the neighorhood again.","5 star rating"

Beef rice noodle was my favourite, followed my Singapore style fried noodle, then the handmade stir fry noodles with beef. Caution about the Singapore style fried noodle though - when you order it less salt, there is also significantly less curry and spices added to it. 

We also ordered the steamed soup dumplings but they were only so-so.

And the food is good. I've had a couple starters and two noodle dishes. The crispy spring onion pancakes (#5) were delicious! There are two in an order and I tried saving the second for my lunch the next day, but I couldn't; I had to tear into it right away. The noodle dishes were good, but not great. I liked the Cantonese chow mein a bit more than the Shanghai style noodles. Both could have used some hot sauce, which I have to remember to ask for next time. For $8-$10 the noodle dishes are BIG and could serve for two meals (which I did) or for sharing.

When I complained about it they lied and said the sand was ""part of the vegetable."" DISGUSTING! and Dishonest.

The whole story:
My wife and I were craving some dumpling and authentic northern Chinese noodle when we saw this place. They had a bunch of news clips on  their window showing that their owner was a master noodle maker. I don't know if the owner changed or something, the current owner is obviously not that noodle master in the news clips. He was speaking Cantonese. I ordered some steamed dumplings and a bowl of sour-and-hot soup. The soup was good but very small, the portion was not worth $2.75.

While drinking my soup I noticed one of the female servers in the kitchen trying to pick something out of a plate with her fingers. This was disgusting to see, but I had no idea what they were picking. When my dumplings arrived, there were strange black spots on more than half of them, but not the other half. So I asked the male server (yes, the one other reviewers mentioned who is touchy with girls) what the black spots were. He said ""vegetables"" and walked away. So I took a bite into one of the dumplings. There was no black spots in the dumplings, just pork and cabbage. So I asked the female server what the spots were, she said they came from the bottom of the pot. I told her they are hard grainy sand and picked one up to show her, she did not even want to see what the spots were, I think she obviously knew, that's why they were trying to pick it out with their fingers. 

I don't care if they want to put sand in their pots. This is a dishonest restaurant because:
1. The noodle master is not there any more, but they still use his name
2. Disgusting finger picking in the kitchen
3. The male server tried to lie by saying the spots are vegetable.

Avoid this restaurant unless you don't care what you are eating.

BTW, they use a lot of MSG","1 star rating"

The staff is very friendly and service was extremely quick but the good ends there.

The prices are on the high side of ""$"" and the food is bland and unimaginative.  It was almost a chore to finish it.

The hygiene is also questionable - my bowl of rice was carried to the table grasped from above in such a way that the waiter's hand was touching the top of the rice.  

Finally, this is a cash-only place with no warning signs about that on the door, so I had to run out and find an ATM after my meal.","2 star rating"

The place was packed so we took the 1st available seat.  It is ""cash only"".  I ordered #16 wontons noodle soup $5.50 and my daughter ordered #13 steamed Chinese dumplings $7.50.  

The portion of other people was very huge.  Most the people ordered some kind of noodle dish without soup.  A lot people eating at the restaurant by himself/herself.  This is not a place to bring smell kids or family because the seating were super close.

My noodle soup came quickly while the steamed dumpling took a little more time.  My daughter was so impressed by the cook in the back because she had a seat facing the kitchen.  My wonton noodle soup was bland and her Chinese dumplings were not up to standard.  The one you buy from the Chinese grocery frozen food section was a lot better back in Chicago.  I think we did not ordered the right dishes at this place.","2 star rating"

Staff is extremely friendly and nice. Service is really fast. Even faster when you speak chinese to them.

My boyfriend and I had ordered the soup dumplings, sweet and sour veggie pork noodle and a beef noodle. The soup dumplings were good, as they are made on the spot. The veggie pork handmade noodle was really good. The beef noodle, not so much.

During the meal, the waiter came to ask me for filling the soup that i was almost finshing it (as I said I was very cold) I never got asking from any chinese restaurants before. That made me surprised and impressed. I tried to get cold water by myself bcoz it was close to the table (we got tea already) I didnt want to bother them.

1. The noodle table is hardly used now for the noodle ""master"" to make noodles. It is only another kitchen counter. 
2. I thought they cooked everything there (the kitchen right next to the dining room, behind the glass), but they actually have 3-4 more people cooking downstairs in a sort of secret kitchen (no wonder meals are ready so quickly!), so the only thing they do in the upstairs kitchen is mix stuff in the wok.

I found this place on Yelp the first night, and we returned every night for 3 nights. The food is good, it's incredibly cheap, the service is fast and friendly...it just can't be beat, and believe me we tried. #30 the Stir fried Singapore style noodles were my absolute favorite (spicy but delicious). Also good were the stir fried hand made noodles, steamed Chinese dumplings, and crispy spring onion pancakes.

Was the service the best?  Was the place kind of cramped?  Would I have preferred my soft drink in a big glass rather than a can?  Yeah, I guess those things could be improved, but for my my money, this place has some really great tasting food.

Noodles are made in house and have a better texture as a result. Their chow meins, noodle soups, meat sauce noodles, and soup dumplings are especially good. Price wise its not worth it to get dim sum here compared to their other dishes, but the har gao and shiu mai are decent too. Prices are very reasonable, and all the workers are really nice.

After going to the movies, he offered we go there for a late snack. 

Even though this place is called the Noodle Factory, he says their specialty is dumplings. We ordered three kinds and ""shared"": steamed seafood (my choice), steamed vegetables (my friend's) and steamed pork with peanut butter sauce (her boyfriend's). 

The plates and the dumplings were huge. I think there were at least 8 dumplings per plate. I couldn't eat them all. Of course, I prefered the seafood, but the pork with the peanut butter sauce were quite good too. I didn't like the vegetable ones, but that's okay. My friend really wanted to eat something healthy.   

Also, they did a ""last call"" before closing the kitchen, which was around 10:30 or 11PM. Don't get in after. Even if there are customers, they won't serve you. 

Price: $25 for the three of us. On average, I think the dumplings were about $7 each, which is a good price.","4 star rating"

My friend and I went on a Sunday evening during the summer, expecting it to be full but it wasn't. We chose the menu for two, which came down to approximately 50$ for both of us, which is very affordable.

The food itself was good, not anything out of the ordinary. The best two plates that we've had were the mango salad and the général Thai chicken.

However, I was quite disappointed by the food for one important reason: I had told the waitress I did not want cilantro at all costs because I cannot tolerate it. She said it was not a problem and that they could make the food without it easily. Perhaps, she might've forgotten because the food came full of cilantro and even removing it, it's a herb so the taste was still impregnated in the food.

Food was alright...
For entrees we ordered Beignets maison de crabe frits and the Rouleau de printemps au crevettes. The two beignets were a little over fried on the outside. The inside was filled with shredded crab,a good combination with the spicy mayo.

The Rouleau de printemps au crevettes, were disappointing. It's an over powering taste of mint, which takes away from any taste of shrimp. It comes with a sweet and sour Thai sauce with some crushed peanuts on top. (Reminds me of the Thai sauce from Costco)

For the main course, we ordered Madame Thai beef and the beef pad thai.
The madame thai beef had a good taste but very salty. It comes with jasmine rice, which help tone down the saltiness but if you want to take a bite of the veggies or beef alone its way too salty. 

The beef pad thai was good but not amazing. The portion was quite small for the price of $15.95.

Very trendy vibe with high tables which makes it seem like a bar but don't stop at drinks, you need to try their food! Although it was loud, they have seating in the back which was quieter and more intimate.

Drinks are very reminiscent of Peru, my favourite was the maracuya sour and they did a very nice pisco sour which was much stronger.

Peru is known for having the best ceviche (to which I can attest to) so we were very excited to try the one at Tiradito. We had both the mango ceviche and classic ceviche. The mango was good but felt more like a salad while the ceviche was great and had a lot of flavour. Both were very refreshing dishes. The latter came with the classic ""cancha"" Peruvian popcorn, which really brings the dish to another level.

We also shared the spicy calamari and the tostadas that I would definitely recommend. The quality of their ingredients is apparent. We ended with the duck anticuchos which did not disappoint either. This is a classic street food in Peru that is typically made of cow hearts but I'm not sure how Montrealers would feel about that. Not certain, but I don't think these were made of duck hearts! Either way, give it a try because they taste like fillet mignon.

For tapas, we had Lobster Causa, Pulpo Al Olivo and Crab Bao fun. Each tapas was almost made to its perfection. The octopus was slightly over cooked but to the core it was delicious.

Ultimately it was a lot of highs and lows for my brother and I on this place.

The best part of our visit here (aside from the sporks!) was the cocktails. I think the marriage of Japanese and Cuban flavours was best embodied in our visit through the drinks. My little mezcal number was down-right delicious. That being said, it took an eternity for our drinks to arrive; to the extent that our food was already on the table by the time they came around.

Speaking more to the service, I found it was notably pretentious (and arguably rude at a couple points) which definitely diminished the experience for me. It's kind of surreal to have a server scoff at you when you ask for two bills, you know?

Otherwise, I thought the space was lovely and the food did the trick. All that being said, I definitely wasn't blown away by the plates we ordered (yuka fries, boudin empanadas, dumplings and mango ceviche) and thought that most things lacked finesse in flavouring. Ultimately I'm convinced I hit an off night- I don't believe that a place of this stature could be so variable in experience. I may or may not try again!","3 star rating"

What is great about Tiradito is that the menu is tapas-style which allows you to sample many offerings from the menu.  The prices vary but they can be as low as $8 or as high as $16.  If you're multiple people this will work out nicely in terms of pricing.  We ordered the dishes that were more on the traditional side of Peruvian food.  

My personal favourite was the papa rellena which featured beef in a chili sauce which was wrapped in a dough and fried.  The ceviche was also really well done and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Alas, the only one that really disappointed me was an octopus dish.  Despite the octopus being cooked to perfection  I wasn't a fan of the olive sauce on it but I also don't like olives much to begin with.    Dessert was a shortbread with dulce de leche inside and an ice cream on the side.  The shortbred was so delicate and flaky.

While they do have beer and wine I was in the mood for a cocktail.  They make their own creations here which are about $12 each which is a little on the expensive side.  I ordered a Maracuyo sour which is similar to a pisco sour except it has passion fruit juice added to it.  It was okay but for $12 it should have been a little stronger.

This is a really fun place to come after work for some drinks and tapas.  It served as my introduction to Peruvian cuisine and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Downtown Montreal is better off for having this place.","4 star rating"

Arriving around 8:30pm on a Saturday night, we were informed that all spots around the central bar were reserved, but they had 2 seats along the side wall. Perfecto!

The space is dimly lit with candles on the bar, and everything is tinged red by the rouge, luminous bird adorning the side wall. There are also plants and candles on the walls which balance the industrial vibe of the space.

All of the drinks on the cocktail menu sound so good. We went with the Chilcano which was tangy and fresh with pisco, ginger, lime, and passion fruit & the Maracuya Sour, a heavier, fruitier drink with passion fruit, tequila, and egg white. Both spectacular, we drank them much faster than we should have. Off to a great start!

For our dishes, we ordered the avocado causa, pato dumplings, and ceviche mixto. The dumplings arrived first, so we unwrapped our napkins and discovered that instead of forks or chopsticks, we were given SPORKS! Definitely unexpected and took a little getting used to (I have to admit I dropped more pieces of food than usual), but they made us slow our eating down and more thoroughly enjoy every bite.

The delectable duck dumplings in a sweet chili sauce were devoured, and then came the avocado causa, a creamy veggie dish with a deliciously creamy sauce, and the ceviche with tuna & avocado, which also came in a divine liquid. Now we understand the sporks! You can pierce the bite of food with the prongs and then fill the spoon portion with the sauce to get the perfect mouthful. Tiradito understands exactly how to bring the most flavor to your meal, and we truly appreciated every bite-- something that doesn't happen enough!

Tiradito caused us to slow down, enjoy each tasty detail, and feel really hip doing it. It's def a must in Montreal.","5 star rating"

The place has a very creative menu with tapas-style plates of Peruvian food with an asian fusion twist. Not a large selection, but enough that if there are several of you and you decide to try a few plates and share, you will have plenty of great discoveries. I went with a friend and we indeed shared many things. We picked everything that had no gluten in it which means we had many of the fish and veggie dishes. I believe the meat dishes that night all had gluten so I did not try them. I loved the ceviches, loved that there was nice colors on the plate, many textures, and overall things I had not eaten before in this type of combination. 
You sit around a long bar that curves around the room so you see them cook and prepare your drinks. Cocktails were amazing too and I tried one with a combination of liquors and juice I had never tried before. Everyone was so friendly, the place was packed and you had to have a reservation, even though I went in the midst of winter and there was a snow wtorm starting outside.
I am planning to go back as the memories are just too perfect!","5 star rating"

Enjoyed about half of the menu but can confidently say you can't go wrong with anything listed on it. The attention to detail on each plate is noticed in each bite and the same for the palette cleansing-cocktails. 

Hard to pick a favorite dish of the night but the BBQ duck bao and white fish ceviche were next level.

Tiradito has a trendy atmosphere and cool vibe. The staff were super friendly and helpful, and gave good recommendations when we asked. Service took a while but the place was busy so it was understandable. Amazing drinks -- my boyfriend had the Maracuya Sour and I had the Inka Colada, and both were delicious! We also really enjoyed what we ordered: Yuca Fries, Papa Rellena, and Ceviche.

Waited about 40 minutes for two spots along the side wall, which were the only spots for walk ins - all of the bar seats were reserved.

The restaurant is tapas style. Our server recommended 2 - 3 dishes per person. We thought we were both pretty hungry, so we were ambitious and went for three dishes each. I didn't try the butifarra sandwich, but almost everything I tried was excellent. My favourites were the octopus anticucho and spicy calamari. The spicy cauliflower was the only dish that really fell flat. It wasn't spicy at all and the combination of the fried cauliflower and coconut milk was too much.

The atmosphere was lively and everyone was there to have a good time. Service was friendly and quick. I would definitely return.","4 star rating"

I was not disappointed. The restaurant itself has a welcoming vibe, more like a bar. The bar seating also makes it a great option for solo diners, even though there are plenty of couples and groups around too. 

They seem to take their drink menu seriously, but I did not partake, so I can't comment on that. I was there for the food. After consulting with one of the helpful cook/waiters, I settled on three dishes: the eponymous tuna tiradito, the braised, then crisped chicharron, and the lobster causa. All were excellent, each a study in contrasts: the meaty tenderness of the tuna balanced with citric acidity and the crunch of roasted corn kernels; the melting tenderness of the pork shank paired with the fatty crispness of the skin; the richness of the lobster with the creaminess of the potato cups and the briny notes imparted by the tobiko. 

I definitely look forward to a return visit here next time I'm thinking of heading close to Old Montreal.","5 star rating"

So let's start with an important piece of information. For a dinner, you'd be probably satisfied with 4 dishes at least, have that in mind, the dishes are supposed to be small so you can try a bit of everything. 

I had the butifarra (holy molly, it's inspired on the Peruvian butifarra sandwich, but the twist is that they fill it with cantonese pulled duck and it's wrapped in a steamed bun) which was one of my favourite dishes, along with the octopus anticucho (came with a bit of causa). Then, I tasted the Peruvian Potatoes which were okay, nothing incredible. The causa was outstanding, made with lobster and topped with caviar.  

I was disappointed with the ceviche, it was too salty and not enough lemony sour taste, it just didn't taste like ceviche. I went with my family and we are all Peruvian, so like the ceviche unfortunately didn't pass the test. 

What blew our minds was the Passionfruit Lemongrass Chilcano, which came with a soursop cream deliciousness stuffed inside a lemon!! It pairs up really well with pisco and I need to drink it again. 

Not all the servers speak Spanish and only a couple are Peruvian, but they were all cordial and helpful. The lighting is dimmed and red, so pictures of your food won't necessarily turn out great. I would definitely make a reservation because it gets busy (be mindful that most seats are at the bar) ! They also offer a birthday cake service, if you are planning to go there for the special occasion, plus you get free shots.","4 star rating"
"1666669928-5764","https://www.yelp.ca/search?find_desc=thai+food&find_loc=Montreal%2C+QC&start=30","Tiradito","https://www.yelp.ca/biz/tiradito-montr%C3%A9al?osq=thai+food","","What a joke the service is here. From other reviews, it looks like a consistent theme at Tiradito. 

My bartender / server didn't even notice me for 15 minutes after I was seated at the bar. She finally noticed after I had to wave in her face like an idiot. 

At that point, I already knew what I wanted to order, since I had all the time in the world to stare at the menu. I put in my order. Which I had to repeat because she couldn't remember 6 items, apparently. Twice I told her my order, yet was never given a table setting (napkin, silverware) at my seat. Ummmm, forget something?? Oh, and no water either. Which I asked for explicitly. I guess item #7 is beyond her memory bank. 

I see the bartender make my cocktail, and put it in front of her. Another 5 minutes passes before she realizes it's there and gives it to me. Still no water. I had to flag her down for some. 

About 25 minutes after putting in my order, my scallop ceviche finally arrives. It's a ceviche, there's no cooking. What the heck took so long?? In Miami, they're out in 5, 10 minutes tops. And Miami is known for horrible service! Lol... At this point, I finally get a fork. Never got a knife or spoon, even though I could see the silverware jars 10 ft away. She also gives me a cupful of cocktail paper napkins. WTF. This isn't some street food joint in Lima. Give me a proper cloth napkin like I see everyone else around me has. 

The fish ceviche is next. It arrives to a confused food runner, who's been more focused on flirting with the girls seated next to me than doing his job the whole night. He walks the ceviche to every other group around the bar, except me for some reason. Finally after handling and breathing on it for 5 minutes, and looking utterly confused, my server directs him to me. I had half a mind to send it back because he touched it so damn much. Seriously, what's wrong with you?

The server, in general, was incompetent. She was spilling sauces, dropping dishes and not seeing food orders at her station the whole night. If you're going with a bar setting and showcase like Tiradito, at least make sure you have competent staff prepping in front of customers. Otherwise, hide the disorder in the kitchen. Just a messy operation. 

At the end of my meal, I get my bill and tip out. She looks at the tip, and asks me: ""Excuse me. Do you understand how tipping works?"" Ahahahahahahaha!! Unbelievable!! Hilarious. Yes, I do. And apparently you don't. In hindsight, I wished I had tipped out a penny. What a bogus attitude. If you want a tip, learn some service.

There is only a long bar in the middle or on the side, so ideal for 2-3 people. The music isn't too loud so you can still talk, although there's a club vibe due to them playing mostly hip-hop and Latin music. It was nice sitting at the centre bar because you could see them prepare the food and their bar was quite spacious. 

Also, they use sporks which I've never used before! It takes time to get used to it but it's nice not having too many utensils in the way. 

The lighting is not the best due to the iconic bird red neon sign, so we couldn't really see how our food looked like. You definitely need to be open minded with trying new food because you will probably not know many ingredient they use. I love discovering new food so this place was perfect for me as they serve tapas, made to share! The only thing is that their menu didn't write down everything that was on the plate, so I couldn't even tell you exactly what I ate, nor could I take pictures to show because of the lighting. 

My favourite were the lobster and the octopus, they are a must try! The ceviche (catch of the day was similar to red snapper) was good but the fish was cut in thin but big slices and even without good lighting I could tell there was some colour missing in the dish. The yucca fries was different than typical fries which I liked, but they weren't anything special. 

What I love about this place is that the tapas are actually made to be shared and the waiter even asked if we wanted 3 portions rather than the typical 2 (since we were 3 people) which was very attentive of him. Their service was well paced as they made sure we finished one tapas before bringing the next one, and the waiter always made sure our water bottle was full. 

Overall, I was extremely satisfied with my experience!","5 star rating"

The idea of merging multiple types of cuisine into something familiar and yet different. Over the past few years however, we have seen more and more a trend back towards restaurants with a clear essence - French, Italian, 'Canadian' but with a focus on fresh local ingredients to sustain that approach. In the end though, every cuisine is a fusion of many - that is the nature of how food evolves between countries and through new cultures immigrating into existing ones. That is what creates more particular fusions - blends of styles that one does not necessarily see as co-existing but do. Tiradito is an example of this.

Located on Bleury St below Rene Levesque, Tiradito is a blend of Peruvian and Japanese cuisine known as Nikkei. Turns out there is a huge Japanese population in Peru which has lead to this blend of cuisine. Chef Marcel Larrea first opened up this restaurant a few years ago to much acclaim - as much for its interesting cuisine as for its unique approach in terms of service. All seating is around a center bar and the service is done by the kitchen staff itself whose individual stations are located in view behind the bar. The service is slightly less personable as a result at times since when your 'waiter' 's station is busy, they don't have time to really follow-up with you but otherwise, it is a cool approach as you see the kitchen prepping your food as you dine which I have always enjoyed to see.

Since this is a Peruvian restaurant, Pisco is a strong component to the cocktail menu. if you love a Pisco sour, you will be well served here. Outside of that, there have some fun options. I opted for the El Vato - White rum, chartreuse, pineapple, sesame, scotch and kaffir lime. Nice presentation and balance - the hint of sesame smokiness is a nice touch on top of the sweetness.

The menu is a mix of sharing-sized plates - vegetarian, meat and fish. We grabbed a few different options to try different parts of the menu. First up, the scallop à la chalaca served with red onions, red chilies, hondashi and ginger. Very bright and vibrant - acidity and sweetness to pair with the nice scallops.

Next up, we ordered the spicy calamari served with salsa criolla. The calamari were nice and plump. The batter was crisp and not too thick either so the natural flavour of the calamari came through. The spicy mayo and the onion salsa were nice compliments to add. Honestly one of the better fried calamari dishes I have had in a while.

The Papa Rellena - a ball of potato and beef deep fried and served with a sweet chili sauce - was a completely new discovery for me and one I enjoyed a lot. Nice crunch on the outside, good flavour in the filling and the sauce provided a nice bit of both heat and sweet to the dish. 

The yucca fries were a hit as well - good crunch and tender interior. Very flavourful and a good compliment to the rest of the meal.

Lastly, I love duck so I had to try the duck anticucho - duck marinated in aji panka, cumin and roasted paprika and roasted on skewers. Sadly this was the dish that impressed the least. The duck itself was cooked nicely - very tender but compared to the rest of the dishes, this one lacked punch.

Tiradito was an experience we really enjoyed. The food was great - very flavourful and fresh - with a nice decor, fun vibe and good music all around. I can definitely see why the reviews have been so positive since its opening. I may not have known about Nikkei Cuisine prior to this experience but I definitely know I am a fan now.

As soon as we arrived we were immediately assigned two seats at the bar, the place looks really nice and trendy, with a big bar at the center and nice decoration. Music is not loud so you can easily have a conversation. The food menu is composed of seafood, vegetables and meat tapas to share. The food was very good and original, mixing salmon with mashed potatoes Peruvian style, as well as duck dumplings, tuna sushi, avocado with potatoes.. the staff and the barmaid were friendly.

The excellent? Drinks were to die for! Some serious mixology talent as they incorporate some Asian flair to Peruvian liquor. The bloody tiger, with its hints of sesame and some other umami flavour took the old Cesar to a whole other level! 

The not so good? Portion were small and steeply priced considering their size. Although we would have loved to spend the night sampling the menu, the small portions cut our evening short as we were still hungry after forking out 30$ each for a drink and some dishes to share.

Food is pretty good but the service absolutely ruins any positive experience you might have. My wife and I sat down and it took our server/bartender 15 minutes to take our drink order. Another 15 minutes to get our drinks. 

The bar back/server comes back to ask if we're ready to order and we ask how many plates we should order. He says 3 per and so we proceed to try to order 5 dishes and he interrupts us and says that it'll be too much food and we should order 4 plates and order more after we get them. 

Uh okay. It takes over an hour and a half to get those 4 plates. They're tiny and we're splitting everything so obviously we're starving. The server/janitor never checked back in to see if we needed another drink. They bring us the wrong dish. Somehow they got confused with our 4 dish order at a tapas restaurant lol. I had to turn our empty water bottle on the side in order to get another bartenders attention to get more water. 

We want more food but don't want to wait another hour so we beg another server for our check and get out of there so we can grab a bite somewhere else.

The server was great. The seating is all on stools at bar-type tables most of which are around the bar\kitchen area, but we were able to get seats (with reservation) in a somewhat more private corner not around the bar. The music was loud and I had to speak loudly to be heard by my date, and that was in the quiet corner.

The sangria which was $32 for a pitcher that was mostly full of ice, was very watered down and did not really taste like Sangria. Two of us (light drinkers) drank the whole pitcher and didn't feel the slightest bit tipsy. The food: the ceviche and GASPOR FARM CHICHARRON were great, but the crab causa, causa de pulpo, and BUTIFARRA SANDWICH were mediocre and certainly not worth the price for the tiny portion size. Overall, the five tapas dishes (which were just enough to fill us up lightly) and the sangria came to $150 including tax and tip. Not worth it, in my opinion.

We started out with drinks (of course). I tried the pisco sour as did most of the rest of my party and so good! Tastes just like the ones in Peru. Then we tried the maracuya (passion fruit) sour (if you like sweet things, def. go with this one). So so yummy. Could've had a whole pitcher of them.
There were five of us and we each got two tapas and split the cost. All of them are good but I'd recommend a million percent the ceviche. So fresh and tasty. 
I'm not a fan of spicy food at all and the menu has a warning of which items are, but we got some of those and I was totally fine. 
The service was great too! Such friendly staff who knew the menu well and added to the experience. They even gave us free shots of pisco. Would definitely go again!
They play Latin music in the background just to add to the ambiance and makes you wanna dance in your seat. 
Last and important thing: completely and reasonably priced for what you get!","5 star rating"

Cons: We went during the recent heat wave and the restaurant didn't have any noticeable air conditioning, and so at the back area where we sat it got quite stifling.  Our server was nice, but the service in general was slow and a bit disorganized - we were served and finished two dishes before our drinks arrived.  When new dishes arrived the empties weren't always taken away, so the narrow bar where we sat got a bit cluttered as we tried to enjoy our meal.  We observed several other parties come in, sit down, wait a while, and then leave after not getting served.  Maybe short staffed that evening?

Overall, would still recommend trying it out for the food but be prepared for possible inconsistent service.","4 star rating"

We had fried chicken which was crispy, moist, and flavorful. We also a few other plates; octopus (savory!), ceviche (spicy! fresh!), cauliflower in a curried broth which was my favorite and I don't even really like cauliflower. I wish I could remember our bartender's name...he was genuine, fun, on top of service.

I went on a Saturday night and it was not packed but it could have been due to the weather conditions not being great. 

My cousin and I ordered the Sake Punch for two people which was very average and diluted.

We shared four dishes...the Albacore Tuna Tiradito, the octopus ceviche, the spicy cauliflower and spicy fried calamari. The tuna felt like it was just taken out of the freezer, the sauce was creamy and good but I didn't like the pairing of the sweet potato in that dish but that's just a personal preference. 
I usually love octopus everything...fried, grilled, in ceviches...but the octopus in that dish was overcooked and chewy elastic like and the sauce was way too acidic, we didn't finish it. The cauliflower and fried calamari were good but nothing out of the ordinary. 

We were full after but left quite unsatisfied. Hopefully it was just an "" off "" night for them.","3 star rating"

They live by their own set of standards on how to properly handle patrons arriving without a reservation. Maybe you'll wait 40 minutes for no text. Or maybe you'll get passed by people who don't have a reservation when you put your name down an hour earlier. Or maybe four different people will tell you ""just another minute"" while the fifth one ignores you. Point is don't waste your time. Don't fall for the presentation and chic interior.

We came here for a date and were amazed by the restaurant - its character, its charm, its energy, its food, and its service. 

Picture this: you're seated at a bar top (there're no tables). At the other side are three food preparation ""stations"" and a drink station, where the chefs serve up the tapas dishes. Despite the hustle and bustle, the chefs move with ease and unhurried grace. They do not just prepare the food. They chat with you, introduce the Peruvian- Japanese (Nikkei) dishes, serve up your tapas, clear your utensils when you're done... oh, and even present you your bill. Is there nothing they do not do? I would call them hosts, not just chefs. 

The food is amazing. We had the cerviche, the duck in a bun, the beef / potato, and the pork. Very delicious, very fresh and beautifully presented. 

For cocktail, we had the pisco sour. Pisco is the Peruvian liquor and not surprisingly it is used in many of the cocktails.","5 star rating"

Peruvian Japanese it's just my style. The concept is amazing and I really like the food. However there are several things that hold it back. 

The first did the fact they have a fruit fly situation. They need to put up some traps or something, I ended up getting a couple in my menu. 

The second is the service. Unfortunately I ordered 3 items and waited an hour and at some point they forgot about me. They gave my food to another table and never came to clean up my table.

Finally the portions are very small. It's designed to share but each one is barely enough for one person. I ate three items by myself and left to go eat somewhere else afterwards.

Oddly enough I do recommend this place to anyone who wants to try it. I just hope that the owners make a few small tweaks to improve it to its full potential.","4 star rating"

I do not plan on going back. In fact my colleagues are going and at first I said I was going to go but now i declined the invitation. The vibe is nice. I think it would be a good place to bring a date or just two girls out for a drink sharing some small plates. Basically everyone sits around the bar but they do have space in the back for larger groups. My cousin and I went on a Thursday night and sat at the bar. I ordered the Bloody Tigre cocktail which is like a bloody Caesar and contains vodka, miso, coriander, hot pepper, marinated vegetables and a sechuan spice rim. I did not enjoy it! i forced myself to drink the whole thing. Reading the ingredients I thought I would like it  because I had the miso bloody caesar at Jellyfish and it was amazing! This one was bitter and sweet at the same time and too many marinated vegetables inside. 

We ordered five dishes to share based on the recommendations of the staff. We had the smoked salmon causa (smoked salmon, maple syrup, potatoe and amarillo pepper). It was good but it tasted like any smoked salmon to me. I didn't taste the maple syrup at all but for me I prefer it that way because I'm not a big fan of salty and sweet. My favorite dish was the octopus anticucho. The octopus was deep fried and it had a creamy sauce but also Hoisin sauce as well. The Hoisin sauce is overpowering and being half chinese I'm used to eating Hosin so maybe that is why I liked this dish the best. We also had the Albacor Tuna Tiradito since that is what it is known for. Hmm it was ok... not memorable. The ceviche of the day was red snapper. OOF This was my least favorite dish. I took one bite and i couldn't eat the rest! what a waste!It was too fishy for me. For the record I like fish that doesn't taste like fish. Even my cousin couldn't eat her half either and she said it got fishier as she ate it. The papa rellena (potato, beef, sweet chili sauce) was fine. The beef was wrapped in big deep fried ball with a creamy sauce underneath. This restaurant seems to have a lot of deep fried stuff which I usually love!

So did the table next to us.

A few examples:
We waited about 20 minutes for our waitress to even come over. She was busy with a big table who was obviously going to give her a big tip. That's fine but just don't completely ignore us. We ordered our food and drinks.

40 minutes later we had received 2 items of food and no drink yet. We finally got her attention again and said should we check in at the bar for the drinks, she said yes that would be better for her. 
Meanwhile she's taking shots with the other table and they have all had 3 drinks a piece in the time we had none.

We are fed up about another 30 minutes later when we ask for our check and instead of helping get us out of there and giving us our check our waitress goes and samples wine for the big group to bring them more drinks. 

Also multiple places still had used dishes etc out there because they had no one to clean them up. It felt like about 5 people called in sick.

So here's my frustration, our table, the table behind us of 4 people, and the people in front of us another 2 people were all upset. When does someone recognize this from management and do something? I.e. Since this girl can't wait on all the tables then put someone else in charge of them? Or something. 

It was incredibly disappointing. Food was good but completely overshadowed but the ridiculous service.","1 star rating"

We were quite hungry so I'm sure they thought we've never eaten before....I think we ended up ordering 7 different items. I started with a smokey mezcal cocktail called Ninmei en Peru...nicely strong, it nearly blew my sandals off! If you have a look at the photos it outlines our meal from start to finish....starting with the scallops and ending with the duck bun The scallop dish was basically a ceviche, and then our second dish was a fish ceviche, but it had a leche de tigre type sauce so it was different enough from the first. Both were light, slightly acidic and made us want more. Then we had the fried calamari ""nuggets"" and the blood sausage empanadas. The empanadas were the favorite dish of the night for my guy, he ordered another round for himself later. They were, as he put it, ""What empanadas should be!"" The calamari was good, not oily and crispy. We then had an octopus dish with an olive sauce, which is totally different from anything I've ever had and my favorite item of the night. We then had a round of steamed dumplings in a sweet and sour sauce, and a duck bao bun - which is an interesting choice for a Peruvian restaurant but they were really succulent and juicy. They seem to be working hard to make delicious food and drinks, go give them a visit.","5 star rating"

It has a fun & lively ambiance & super friendly staff. The pisco sour was delicious. We asked our waiter to select dishes for the six of us to share - and he did not disappoint. We started with the cauliflower in coconut curry, which was light & flavourful. We also sampled the calamari, tostadas, lobster causa, fish of the day ceviche, kimchi, potatoes, duck sandwich, and blood pudding empanadas. So LOTS of food, but small portions so we just had the perfect tasting. My favourites were the lobster & tostadas. The empanadas were also amazing. Surprisingly my least favourite was the ceviche. But perhaps I just didn't like the fish of the day (red snapper type fish). We ate so much there was no room for dessert. I highly recommend going here w a group of friends. A fun & tasty experience.

The Papa Relleno was tasty but not served hot. It was lukewarm. The Squid was worse. It reminded me of eating Show leather. I sent it back immediately and drank my crappy craft beer.

Her excellent mixology skills were impressive, and she helped us decide on menu choices. We got six different tapas plates, which was perfect, about two per person. Everything was excellent, our favorite was the pollo frito.

They highly recommended the recently opened Tiradito, and specifically recommended their ""fish"" dishes. They love Nikkei cuisine and Tiradito fit the bill perfectly. 

This restaurant/bar is extremely popular so reservations are highly recommended. They have a 6 o'clock seating and an 8 o'clock seating. 

After ordering our cocktails, our group of four ordered a mixture of dishes. Their fried foods were my favorite; I loved the octopus anticucho and peruvian potatoes. They both had the perfect amount of crispiness on the outside and a soft interior. The spicy cauliflower dish has a thai curry flavor to it. The avocado causa did not stand out particularly in my mind.   Our two ceviches ( mixed ceviche and fish ceviche) were good, but I am no expert on ceviche. We didn't order the albacore tuna tiradito but I really wished we had tried it. By the end, we were still a little hungry and so we each had a butifarra sandwich. This is very similar to Momofuku`s pork belly buns, it tasted like a steamed bun à la Peking Duck. We finished off the dinner by splitting a dessert (the waiter was so kind he even split it into four plates for us!!)  It was the perfect way to end our dinner.  

I loved that we ate with sporks, but when we requested an extra spoon to use for sharing the dishes (especially the soupier ones), they told us to just use our spork.  Couldn't they just spare one extra spoon?! Luckily we were all good friends... but still... hygiene is important guys...

The menu is short with very few vegetarian options.   Our vegan friend had to be creative and requested a vegetarian bun be made.  They were happy to accommodate and brought her a sweet potato steamed bun sandwich which she enjoyed. The waiters were all extremely friendly and genuinely happy to share their culture with us. 

Overall, I had a very nice evening and I would be happy to return.  I loved the decor and ambiance. If you are a couple, you could sit at the bar and watch everyone at work. If you are a bigger group, there is a long communal counter with stools. One thing we noticed at the end of the night was that we were constantly looking for a place to rest our feet.  We were all looking for a non-existent beam under the table to rest our hanging legs on. Hopefully, they will install a wooden beam under the tables by the time I return for my next meal :)","4 star rating"

The place is beautiful - well appointed and thoughtfully designed. We found the service to be inconsistent - the hostess was chilly and the server was inexperienced and unable to describe menu items (there are not many to learn) or the wine list. Most importantly, the food fell flat.  Flavors were uninspired and didn't live up to our expectations. The pork shank was dry and over fried, the octopus leathery and the dumplings seemed to offer nothing more than you can get from a frozen grocery store brand. A bright spot - the cocktails.  They were beautiful and delicious. I wouldn't spring for dinner here again, but would have a cocktail.","3 star rating"

My favourite was the El Vato which had, among other things, sesame seeds in it. And the glass was wrapped in a leaf. The sharing plates here are to die for, and to pick a favourite would be tough, but if pushed I think it might be the parmesan scallops. We had the pleasure of meeting the head chef briefly, and this guy has a good thing going. We also loved the design of the space. It seats 50, but all bar or communal seating, so the staff have a very large space in the middle to work their magic, and magic they do work. The team is spectacularly calm, and they clearly work together as a team. No one got uptight, despite being full up all night. Make a reservation because they have two seatings and then try to accommodate walk-ins. We go out A LOT, and this was a wonderful, completely unique experience, from the cocktails, to the food, to the atmosphere. Well done, Tiradito!

Siam is located on a second level in one of the buildings in DIX30. Parking can be on the street, but go into the underground parking as it's free and well you can basically walk around to the right building underground when it's super snowing or cold and pop up in the right building. It's pretty amazing, but I guess this is standard in snowy climate areas.

When you walk to Siam, there is seating inside if you're wanting to eat there. Just remember to bring your Covid card to prove your vaccination status and also just make sure to check to make sure you know the requirements when dining in as the rules seem to change every where not just in Canada. 

We were here just to pick up, so we ordered ahead and it was fairly straight forward. We got a variety of items but of what I had was pad see ew, beef jerky, and panang curry (descriptions and pricing below)

BŒUF SÉCHÉ SIAM - $13.95 
SIAM BEEF JERKY 
Bœuf mariné, séché et frit. Salade de papaye marinée et sauce lime et poisson. // Marinated beef, dried and deep fried, marinated papaya salad and fish & lime sauce.
~ This was truly a jerky. It was hard, but very very flavorful and went well with the fish and lime sauce. I don't think I'd get this again but it was something different that we've never had from a Thai spot.

CARI PANANG AU BŒUF - $30.95 
BEEF IN PANANG CURRY 
Bœuf braisé, cari Panang, lait de coco, feuille de kaffir // Braised beef, Panang curry, coconut milk, kaffir leaves
~ Very flavorful curry. I would totally get this again but wowsers, that price is kind of giving me a heart attack.

PAD SEEW - $23.95 
Bœuf, nouilles de riz, gailan, œuf, sauce soya // Beef, rice noodles, Gailan, egg, soy sauce
~ Pretty standard pad see ew. I wish there was more veggies, but there was plenty of beef!

Overall, very expensive Thai food but that seems to be the case when we're not in the US. It was all quite standard with good flavors. Missing a lot of veggies, but then again not many Thai dishes focus on veggies (well nothing in Canada seems to be heavy in veggies). Good to try but can't say it was the best Thai I've ever had.","3 star rating"

The restaurant is situated overlooking the square in Dix30, surrounded by other popular restaurants in the area. The décor is stunning; dim lighting with a warm, inviting ambiance. There are larger tables for big groups, banquet style seating and even tables with swings as seats!

For appetizers, there are some great choices. As a group of 5, we ordered karee puffs (taro and sweet potato crispy rolls), papaya salad and coconut shrimp to share; everything was extremely delicious, however, for the quantity received, it is very overpriced - 18$ for 5 shrimp tempura, served with the tiniest amount of sauce enough for just 1 tempura and not even a hint of coconut... quite ridiculous.
For the mains, there aren't that many options for vegetarians. We ordered the Vegan Pad Thai, Yellow tofu curry and the Green curry which we asked to be changed to shrimp instead of beef/chicken (for which they charged an additional 5$ for). Having been to other Thai restaurants in Montreal, I would rate the curries 4 out of 5 - the taste was good overall but there just seemed to be some flavour missing.  

Being a Friday evening, the atmosphere was quite chaotic and the waitress seemed to be in a rush to tend to other tables, meaning we had to wait for ages to get rice or water refills.

Siam is one of the restaurants in the square that has a terasse. Located on the second floor, the decor was exquisite-meeting traditions of thai with modern elegance. We didn't need reservations to get a table- I don't think that's the case with any of the these dix30 square restaurants.

The menu is definitely pricey for the quality of food. Cocktails start at 11$, wines start at 16$ a glass. I originally ordered the night in thailand but they ran out of carnation milk. So I picked the mai thai- which was ok. The cocktails were definitely NOT the game player of Siam. 

We ordered a taster sampler- that included 3 of each of the following-spring rolls (quite small), chicken wings, chicken skewers, coconut style shrimp tempura for 39$ for the whole sampler- this was comparable to a KFC 5$ bucket. None of these flavours stood out- and for the price I was paying I would've appreciated more pieces and dipping sauce considering at cost- these guys are making a lot of money off this dish! Be nice!

For our mains: we did the cod yellow curry (3/5) the cod was well cooked and served on a bed of fried rice noodles (cute). The red duck curry (3/5) was served in a coconut cream sauce with lychees and pineapples- the duck was well done. The chicken cashew stole the show (4/5) I enjoyed the presentation in a metallic stir fry pan and the flavours were bold and not too spicy. The cashews and mushrooms in this dish were subtle. 

A turnoff to most of these restaurants in dix30-the servers don't speak a word of English or poor attentive skills. We asked if the jasmine rice that comes with the dish is served in a traditional thai woven basket-waitress had nodded. This was not the case- we got jasmine rice served in regular bowls. I get this is not a big issue for most but, we ended up ordered an additional sticky rice for 1.00$ because she could not make a word of what we asked. Another server had to come in to rectify the situation and give us additional utensils.

Topping at 70$ pp, this was not worth any of it, too pricey for a fancy dining hall with mediocre quality food.","3 star rating"

It's situated in the quartier Dix30 in Brossard. Decorations are cozy and modern. I ordered a Pad Thai on their lunch menu. The lunch menu is very reasonable pricing wise. You get a soup or a salad and a coffee or tea with it. 

The Tom yum soup was sweet and spicy as it should be. It's not a spicy that you can't handle; might be a bit soft for someone who can handle their spices but for anyone who doesn't eat spicy it's an enjoyable spicy.
The Pad Thai was decent; to be completely honest it wasn't the best Pad Thai I had in town but it was decent. The noodles were bit too soft to my taste but the shrimp and the taste were fairly good. 

One thing about Siam is it's presentations are top qualities.

Yes the drinks are pricey!
Yes this place may not be Authentic Thai!

But this place is hands down the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. Siam has a cool, modern and contemporary ambiance that adds a really nice vibe to your dining experience. 

The service was great. A lot of the restaurants we went to in Montreal didn't have good service, but this restaurant's service was probably the best service we had in Montreal.  We didn't have to flag down anyone for water. The waiter was very helpful and answered all our questions.

We went here with four friends and we all decided to start off by sharing appetizers. So we started off with the Degustation platter, which includes Spring Rolls, Chicken Satay, Duck Wontons, Imperial Rolls, and Wrapped Shrimps ($35). All of the food in the degustation platter were good, but the Duck Wontons were my favorite.  I just wished I would've had more, but then again its great I didn't because I wouldn't have room for our entrees.

For our entree we ordered 1 order of Chef Panithit's Crispy Chicken ($24) (Battered, fried chicken, chili paste and garlic) and 2 orders of Roasted Duck in Red Curry ($25 each) ( Roasted duck, cherry tomatoes, Thai eggplants, lychees, pineapples, red curry, kaffir lime leaves and basil.) The Crispy chicken was amazing. I will never go to KFC again! It was perfectly crispy and extremely flavorful. The red curry roasted duck was perfect. It was extremely flavorful and had a nice kick to it. The portions size were reasonable and we all left full and happy. We couldn't even finish all our food. We had to take some food to go.

The next time i'm in Montreal, I will definitely go back to this place. I'm so glad that my friends took us here, otherwise we wouldn't have ever known to go based on the yelp reviews. I'm shocked that i'm the only one on yelp who gave this place a 5 star review. Please listen to me and check this place out. You will not be disappointed!","5 star rating"

The food took longer than usual to come out, but the service was still great.

The food is okay - some dishes are better than others, namely the chicken skewers and pad thai - but for the most part it's just ""okay"". 

That would be fine if the decor was unpretentious and the prices reasonable, but 120$ for an average meal without alcohol is just too much. There's so many wonderful reasonably-priced Asian restaurants that Siam just isn't worth it.

One last note: the crispy chicken is just a weak attempt at a General Tso chicken with terrible batter and a sauce with no kick. Same for the garlic shrimps - the batter spoils the whole thing.","2 star rating"

I had a great experience with family here. Ordered shrimp in puff pastry(more like phyllo or wanton wrapped) this was the least of our favorite. Had 4 entrees to share, duck in curry, beef in curry, padthai and crispy chicken.  Duck in curry had lychee and pineapple was on the seeet savory side, duck was like the chinese toast duck. Beef was moist and tender, curry sayce with it was amazing. Padthai was on the sweeter side was really good. Crispy chicken was a mountain of chicken. Cant say more. Unlimited jasmine rice by the way. And they had a sick rooftop patio!","5 star rating"

It is an ideal setting to create memories and it would be complete if only the food was as memorable; while I believe Siam deserves its 5 stars for the atmosphere (music, decor and service), it would get a decent yet average 3 star rating from me in the food department. A polite and pleasant waiter served food which was overpriced and, unfortunately, a bit heavy on the stomach. Nonetheless, my fiancé and a friend, with whom I shared the only 3 available vegetarian dishes available, had a good time, and so did I! If you have some space left at the end of your meal, I recommend the chocolate cake with coco ice cream; good enough for me to concede and round up the rating to 4 stars.","4 star rating"

But for the food and the pay you price not so nice. The wine is expensive and the only bottle that was 30$ was disgusting. You really should share your plates cause the waiter didn't tell us and we had way to much. The ginger chicken was good but not for the price and the chicken of the chef is just panned i didn't even find the chicken. Also the salad doesn't included lettuce and is way to much spicy. My friend returned her plate cause it wasn't good an she got something else to eat when all our plates were gone. The service wasn't that good also. The presentation of the mediocure food  was unbelievable though. 

Really just a trendy place where you go to look around but not to enjoy the food. It would of been better and cheaper a little Thai restaurant for lunch.","2 star rating"

The service was professional and courteous.  We were informed that the menu is conducive to sharing, so my friend and I ordered the chicken satay and shrimp wrapped in pastry to start.  The presentation was very appealing; the appetizers came out on ""lollipop"" style a wooden plank.  The satay came with a creamy peanut sauce and the shrimp came in a sweet and spicy one.  Both plates came accompanied with sweet and spicy cucumbers and onions, which was as great as a palate cleanser as it was a refreshing mini side-salad (for us, we're small girls!).  My only complaint with these dishes were that they were room temperature, and that the shrimp were skewered in such a way that made them a little awkward for dipping.  

For mains, we ordered the red curry and rad na (beef and noodles with broccoli), and both came with an order of rice.  The red curry had crisp slivers of red pepper, green beans, chicken, and eggplant, and swam in a rich broth of red curry and coconut milk.  It was an instant winner with my girl friend.  Although the menu indicated ""2 chillies,"" it really wasn't very spicy at all.  Given that my friend doesn't like heat, it was fine for the two of us, but I recommend asking for a spicier dish if you like it hot.  As for the rad na, this was my favourite, perhaps because I rarely order dishes that are sweeter rather than spicy.  I'd recommend it, however, my other complaint was that we were not given serving spoons/forks, and had to ask for knives as well.  

I'd like to comment on the drink menu and their desserts, but we were simply too stuffed to have any, and ended up packing two ""to-go"" bags at the end of the night (props for good portion sizes).  The night out ended up costing us 70 dollars (without tip, drinks, or dessert), so the place is a little steeper in prices than a regular night out.

I would definitely recommend this place again, and look forward to my next visit!","4 star rating"

The Tom yum soup is way too different from it supposed to be tasted like. In addition, I paid $10 just for a tiny bowl of soup. I had crispy chicken which tasted like dry version of general Tao. Red curry duck was ok. But.... Can u imagine a fancy Thai restaurant doesn't have Thai tea... The spring rolls are way too expensive.

It is a nice and warm place located in a quiet street, never too noisy or crowded. This is my favourite dumpling place in Montreal.
As an Asian, I have my own standard for good dumplings. This place makes everything from scratch (the shell, filling and even the chilli sauce), you can even hear them chopping the the meat in the kitchen (trust me, hand-chopping makes a huge difference in the filling). The taste is really simple and balance. The dumplings are only filled with basic ingredients such as pork with cabbage or beef with coriander (my favourite), but in every bite, you can taste each ingredient distinctively. With the vinegar and chilli sauce, oh man, that's so tasty and fulfilling. Btw, the dumplings are really juicy and hot inside, so slow down and try not to burn your month.","4 star rating"

Went there on a Thursday night with my boyfriend. We didn't have a hard time finding the place because we had read reviews on Yelp beforehand so we were keeping an eye out for it. It's a house remodeled into a restaurant and I think it's family run. They were two cooking in the kitchen and one serving customers. Since the restaurant is small, it felt really cozy and a nice change of pace from a hectic workday. The seats were large which, as a tall person, is always appreciated. It is small so I wouldn't recommend going with more than 3-4 people (You can take them to go though). There was lukewarm lemon infused water and we ordered the chicken mushroom dumplings and the pork cabbage dumplings. We were not expecting the size of the dumplings to be so big but we enjoyed every bite! Service was faster than expected too and the green tea ice cream was very good! At first we wanted black sesame but they didn't have any left :,( The waitress was nice, overall very good and would come back!
----------------------------
J'y suis allée un jeudi soir avec mon copain. Nous n'avons pas eu de problème à trouver le restaurant puisque nous avions lu des commentaires Yelp avant. C'est une maison-devenue-restaurant et je crois que c'est un restaurant familial. Deux travaillaient dans la cuisine et une servait les clients. Puisque le restaurant est petit, il était très chaleureux, un bon changement d'une longue journée au travail. Les chaises étaient larges, ce qui est toujours apprécié puisque je suis grande. Vu que l'endroit est petit par contre je ne recommanderais pas d'y aller à plus de 3-4 personnes (vous pouvez les commander pour emporter par contre). Il y avait de l'eau tiède infusé de citron et nous avons commandé les dumplings poulet-champignon et porc-choux et nous avons savouré chaque boucher! Le service étai plus rapide de ce à quoi nous nous attendions considérant le nombre d'employés et la crème glacée au thé vert était aussi très bonne! Nous voulions sésame noire, mais il n'y en avait plus :( La serveuse était gentille, gobalement très bon et je reviendrais sûrement si jamais je suis dans le coin!","5 star rating"

We ordered the pork chive, lamb coriander, chicken coriander and egg shrimp chive. The wrapper was delicious, there was alot of filling and not too much doughy wrapper and you really tasted the filling of each dumpling. Although the waitress described each dumpling dish, I was able to taste in the flavors and knew which was which without her explanation. I find I can never truly taste the flavors at other dumpling restaurants. The restaurant itself doesn't have many seats so I suggest doing takeout or placing an order and eating in the park.

They offer a decent selection of dumplings and it is possible to mix them. We ordered pork+shrimp+zucchini, chicken+coriander and had them steamed. We also tried beef+onion and pork+cabbage and we had them fried. I personally preferred the latter. Prices were quite reasonable for the # of dumplings we had (10-12$ for 16). Few things I didn't like were the lack of saltiness in the pork meat and there wasn't much soup inside each dumpling.  Overall,  it was decent but I'm not sure if I would come back to try the rest of their menu.","3 star rating"

But what they do and do well are dumplings. 
We had the chicken and mushroom; pork and cabbage; lamb and coriander; miso soup; seaweed salad.  
All dumplings were good.  I especially liked the chicken dumplings.  My wife favored the lamb.
The time of night that we got there, the chef makes all the dumplings by hand per order.  You can actually watch him put the dumplings together.  
The waitress felt our order took to long and she brought a seaweed salad to the table on the house.  I told her if the food is good, I have no problem waiting for it.
I really enjoyed the seaweed salad ! 
Dumplings are very labor intensive.  From the hand rolled fresh dough, the ingredients mixture, putting them together and finally cooking them.  
With all that said dumplings range in price from $ 9.99 - $11.99 per order.  There are 16 dumplings per order.
I felt this was a very fair price and we have good leftovers for tomorrow.

It's all too easy to just go to your old dependable Qin Hua or Mai Xiang Yuan, and roll your eyes as ""yet another"" restaurant opens in your neighbourhood. Biking down Clark towards Sherbrooke, just past Prince-Arthur, I don't even recall if there was anything in this space before Dumpling Hut. What the hell?

My biggest criticism of dumpling restaurants in the city comes down to the filling. It all tastes the same to me (with the exception of vegetarian fillings which are consistently disappointing. Steamed, watery egg? No thanks.) When you pack enough sodium and MSG into a pork or beef base, you're going to get the same hit of delicious grease and sodium, but as my lunch companion on this day remarked, you won't be able to make rhyme from reason, resulting in the vague taste of ""beast"".

I'm happy to report that the dumplings here at Dumpling Hut are *almost* underseasoned. Almost. Meaning, they're of a perfect saltiness. Combined with soy sauce, vinegar, and/or chili oil, it's just right. And between the dill/pork and beef/coriander, you could actually taste individual ingredients. *Imagine that*. Only downside is that there's no option to have your dumplings fried, but personally I don't mind so much.

The cucumber salad also provided a nice, flavorful starter.

Once you overcome the feeling that you're eating inside a stranger's apartment with a totally random dormant traffic light as a prop, you're all set.

The flavour was lacking, and the price for a dish is more expensive than the other well known dumpling places (in China Town and near Guy Concordia). The dumplings also didn't have much soup inside, which was a bit of a let down compared to the rivaling dumpling places. 

Their cheapest option is $9 before tax+tip for 15 dumplings, which is more than the other places, for less flavoursome dumplings.

The service wasn't great, our water wasn't refilled a single time despite being the only customers in the restaurant at the time (it was early). 

If you're looking for dumplings and this is the only place close to you, you'll probably enjoy it! However, if you have the option to choose between multiple places and distance isn't a big deal, I'd recommend the dumpling place in China Town over this one.","3 star rating"

My wife and I were starving after we got off the Amtrak train from upstate Ny. We were greeted with plump handmade dumplings after a 7 hour train ride. We had the pork, chicken, and lamb with cilantro ( called coriander) and one with egg, scallion, and shrimp. Each plate contains 16 dumplings. 

All 64'of our dumplings were as tasty as the last. We had ours steamed, but looks like you can request them to be fried. 

So why the 4 stars and not 5? It's a little expensive. Although handmade, dumplings are normally somewhere around $.35 to $.45 per. Seafood should add an additional $.15 per. But this averaged about $.86 per. 

Something that would probably add more value would be to give some sort of clear broth soup and/or some small side dishes as part of the meal. 

We got miso soup as well, but $3.99 was kind of a lot of miso soup. Normally that's served for half that. 

But, eating the dumplings.... you forget all that. They just taste so clean and pure that I would continue eating if I didn't run out of room.

In the area and want a quick bite, this is the spot. Incredibly fast considering they are hand made. 64 dumplings came out within 15 mins.","4 star rating"

Found it on yelp looking for Chinese in the area I was staying, this place is an experience. It is basically in someone's house, very very bare bones set up, which means it is really damn good. Use google maps or keep an eye out for the dumpling sign out front, you will miss it, it's literally the first level of a town home made into a resto.

It's like eating at a family's house, you see one of the ladies making the dumplings right there, and they are tasty/fresh. I'm a vegetarian and they had a few veggie options which was great.

I kinda want to keep this place a secret so I don't end up coming and finding it full...but I also want to give them a little boost since I really, really like their dumplings.
I would defintiely recommend a stop here if that's what you're craving.

The place is not a hut but a very fun ground floor apartment occupied by some very amiable Chinese dumpling masters or should I say mistresses because we didn't see any men. The Hut lacks any special decor but it is unique in that you  are practically eating In your Chinese auntie's kitchen.
Oh yes about the dumplings, they were very good but they didn't knock my socks off. We had the lamb and coriander and the egg shrimp and chive dumplings.
A plate runs between $10 and $13 and the selection includes pork shrimp chicken egg and veggie but there was no combination plates so you had order a big plate of 15. Get it?
So if you're craving dumplings and are looking for cheap eats in an immaculately clean apartment this is a great option.
With dumplings as good or better than some of the abattoirs in nearby Chinatown, this hut is a good bet.","4 star rating"

I would recommend the general tao chicken, beef and broccoli, beef and spicy peppers and the Cantonese noodles with mixed vegetables.

But first, I HIGHLY recommend taking a look at their online menu (just google ""Aunt Dai menu"" - you'll be glad you did, it's an incredibly entertaining read.

Have been ordering from here more during lockdowns, as Chinese food is one of those cuisines that is just fine eaten a little later, or reheated. 

I'm a huge fan of two dishes in particular: 

1. The Grilled beef slices (tiě bn niú li ), and
2. the Braised pork belly with sweet potato noodles (Hóng Shāo Ròu Dùn Fěn Tiáo).

I find that each dish ordered will either serve 2-3 if served with a side of rice or noodles.

We had one issue ordering from them recently, as they had given our order away to the wrong person, so it took much longer to get our food. But they rectified the issue and we will certainly be back again for more.","5 star rating"

We ordered:
General tao, beef and brocoli, fried noodles with mixed vegetables, a wonton soup, a sweet and sour soup and an order of spring rolls. 

Wonton soup was delish. All three mains were very tasty and good portions. Finally I got chicken that wasn't overbreaded! I was very pleased. The only disappointment was the spring rolls which were tiny and bland. I'm not sure if they were fresh.

One issue I've had when ordering Chinese is that the boxes aren't always sealed and it becomes an oily mess everywhere. This place uses reusable plastic containers for the most part which avoids mess and is better for the environment.

One thing I wish they had is full meal options (ex. Soup, egg roll and mains as a package deal). Ordering individual dishes gets a bit expensive! It was 60$ for everything which isn't so bad and I had a lunch for the next day. However, for orders for bigger groups, ordering individual dishes may not be worthwhile.

The peppers are also have no flavor either. I had this dish a week ago in NyC and a random Szechuan restaurant and it was completely different and way better. On their website they say how important the moisture is and cooking this dish properly, but it seems to me they get it completely wrong. I also got the green beans which were very mediocre.

Cuisine AuntDai, which specializes in Sichuan food, was next on the list. It's located upstairs of SAJ Mahal. 

We dropped in on a Thursday evening (around 6:30pm). The inside is nicer than your typical Chinese spot. Heck, they even have a massive upstairs area (which was completely empty). 

The menu is a mix of authentic and Canadianized Chinese food. There's appetizers, main dishes, vegetarian, rice and noodles, desserts and drinks. There's also a few pages of handwritten specials; rabbit with Sichuan chili sauce sounded good. 

Check their website: someone (maybe Aunt Dai?) has written a description and review on almost every dish. A good read!

- Tea ($0.99) - lame that they charge you for tea. 
- 2x Steamed rice ($1.49)
- Twice-cooked pork ($12.99) - pork, green pepper, garlic and Sichuan peppercorns. This was a tad spicy and oily but tasty. Liked the mix of vegetables (carrots, onions and green peppers). Pork was slightly fatty but cooked excellently. 
- Cabbage stir-fry ($9.99) - I was a bit skeptical to order cabbage but this was simple, tender and tasty.
- Mapo tofu ($10.99) - tofu, beef and parsley. This came out much later than the other two dishes. Tofu was tender but the dish lacked any heat or numbness. The one I had at Délice Oriental was better.

Good but oily food. 3.5 stars.","3 star rating"

It is similar to your typical Chinese restaurant but with less breading and more meat, less grease and oil and much more flavour. 

I would recommend the general tao chicken, beef and broccoli, beef and spicy peppers and the Cantonese noodles with mixed vegetables. All their dishes are reasonably priced and arrive super hot (ordered through Uber eats). The food tastes really fresh and authentic (for those dishes that are actually authentic, check their online website for info!). 

Overall, I am very satisfied with their flavours and can' wait to order from them again!

But first, I HIGHLY recommend taking a look at their online menu (just google ""Aunt Dai menu"" - you'll be glad you did, it's an incredibly entertaining read.

Have been ordering from here more during lockdowns, as Chinese food is one of those cuisines that is just fine eaten a little later, or reheated. 

I'm a huge fan of two dishes in particular: 

1. The Grilled beef slices (tiě bn niú li ), and
2. the Braised pork belly with sweet potato noodles (Hóng Shāo Ròu Dùn Fěn Tiáo).

I find that each dish ordered will either serve 2-3 if served with a side of rice or noodles.

We had one issue ordering from them recently, as they had given our order away to the wrong person, so it took much longer to get our food. But they rectified the issue and we will certainly be back again for more.","5 star rating"

We ordered:
General tao, beef and brocoli, fried noodles with mixed vegetables, a wonton soup, a sweet and sour soup and an order of spring rolls. 

Wonton soup was delish. All three mains were very tasty and good portions. Finally I got chicken that wasn't overbreaded! I was very pleased. The only disappointment was the spring rolls which were tiny and bland. I'm not sure if they were fresh.

One issue I've had when ordering Chinese is that the boxes aren't always sealed and it becomes an oily mess everywhere. This place uses reusable plastic containers for the most part which avoids mess and is better for the environment.

One thing I wish they had is full meal options (ex. Soup, egg roll and mains as a package deal). Ordering individual dishes gets a bit expensive! It was 60$ for everything which isn't so bad and I had a lunch for the next day. However, for orders for bigger groups, ordering individual dishes may not be worthwhile.

Overall, very good! 4.5 stars","5 star rating"

After going over the menu and pictures on Yelp, I ordered the General Tao Chicken and Hot Pepper with Beef! Both ended up being excellent options but the beef was exceptionally tasty. The food was absolutely delicious, spicy and the ingredients were high quality and fresh! 
The food arrived in perfect condition as they have great packaging.

When I got there, I saw there's a bookshelf for you to donate or take books! Amazing.

And the owner is such a sweetheart. I asked for a cup of water, and he didn't have any. He offered a free Coke or Ginger Ale instead, but I declined.

After I got home, I savored that cumin beef. It was spicy enough for my spice levels and so flavorful. And those caramelized onions 

I was able to split the beef into two meals along with veggies and carbs I had at home. I'm used to having meals that include these and the meat at the same price, though I can definitely vouch for the taste and quality of this dish. Aunt Dai, I'll definitely be back!","5 star rating"

I went with a group of 10 friends to celebrate lunar new year on a Thursday evening. We were ushered to a large circular table, complete with lazy susan near the back. It was a bit of a tight fit, but we managed. Bigger groups might have an issue, though there is more seating upstairs.
We ordered 10 dishes, with a bowl of rice for each (1.50 each). Water was promptly poured, and I was glad it wasn't ice water (ice water is a horrid thing, you can't change my mind). The entire place was empty when we arrived, and remained that way for a while, though a few people trickled in near the end. 
The food we ordered was great! I don't have any complaints regarding what I tried. The fried rice did contain mushrooms though despite no mention on the menu, to my roommate's chagrin (she abhors them). My favorites were definitely the pork belly with noodles - probably one of the best and most popular dishes, with unctuous fatty belly chunks, thick chewy sweet potato noodles (must order!), the sacha beef or sizzling beef (similar) which had faultlessly tender beef, and three cup chicken which was fragrant and sweet, and the salt and pepper fish and fried pork were fantastic as well. They have a menu online for your perusal- i highly suggest you read the owners comments on the english version, highly entertaining and insightful info!
Shockingly, we finished all the food we ordered, and the prices were very reasonable, considering how stuffed we were. Overall I'm very impressed with the food, the vibe, and the friendliness of the staff. I would definitely come back.","5 star rating"

I've been here so many times and I've yet to order all the vegetarian dishes.

Aunt Dai is glorious. Do yourself a favour ... get super baked, hangout, get the munchies ... and then go to the Aunt Dai website. Seriously. Go to the website and look at the chef's own reviews of the dishes on the menu.

You've read that correctly, folks, the chef and owner of Aunt Dai writes a review of each and every item on the menu. And guess what? They're hilarious; this is truly a specimen of true genius. These chef's own reviews basically render ... all of this (pointing to you, Yelp, and to myself in the mirror, me) ... pointless, meaningless and obsolete.

You know how mom&pop's places or your typical joints would still have that ""charm"", this place is just flat out dark and cold lol! Literally. Everytime someone walks in, we would freeze our butts off all over again)

Now that I got that out of the way, let's talk about the food :D Like I said, it was a nice little surprise. I myself am not a fan of Chinese food and neither are 2 other of the 3 friends that were there with me... weird, yes but I heard good things so we went for a little discovery :)

Our favorite dish was the braised pork belly with sweet potato noodles. We also took the spicy peanut chicken, spicy pork sauté with mushrooms and a beef sauté. Everything tasted good. Some more spicy than others but nothing we couldn't handle. I think we'll come back to try out other stuff next time but it'll be take-out","4 star rating"

The real gem here is the website, where each item on the menu comes with the *owner's own commentary*. I LOVE this. Get this description of their very own orange beef: ""Comparing to our General Tao Chicken, this one is not THAT good. Anyway, I am not big fan of North American Chinese food and it's your call.""

Or the braised pork belly: ""This is a very popular dish among the customers who don't care its greasiness. The flavor is really rich and perfectly balanced. You almost want to sniff the tasty hot air above this beautiful dish... So even you love it, you may not want to have it every time if you are watching your weight because you know you cannot stop if you have started on this one. This is the only reason I try to keep myself away from this plate.""

It is incredibly aromatic, fresh, and perfectly-seasoned. My friend brought me here assuring me that they were authentically made and tasty renditions of dishes she ate while growing up. The service was awesome and very attentive although we were some of the only customers (on a weekday early evening). The food is incredibly priced for the portion size and the amount of meat: we ordered the sweet and spicy eggplant and the braised porkbelly with sweet potato noodles and were thoroughly stuffed by the time we finished eating.
Since quarantine began I've been ordering their food through delivery as well as takeout (pickup). Both times the food has been very fresh and warm, and the portion size was huge as usual! They are very well organized during pickup: if you call in advance and give them a pickup time they will ensure your food is ready, and they carefully sanitize the card reader for each customer. Additionally, I believe they offer loyalty points during this time for rewards once dine-in begins again.
Some other dishes I have tried were the cumin beef and the eggplant, potato, & bell pepper dish. I loved them both as well and I highly recommend them! Definitely consider supporting this local restaurant, you will not be disappointed!","5 star rating"

This is the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. 
The best part are the comments that the owner makes on the website's menu. She is very straight to the point, telling you EXACTLY which menu items she does and does not like (often opting out of the westernized dishes.) It kills me, I find it hilarious, but I have also used her advice and it has paid off for me. 
My favourite dish is the spicy fish filets. I prefer the ones not served in the soupy sauce, but the drier ones. I always order it with rice. 
Next up is the sweet and spicy tofu (now that I'm vegan I can pretty much only have this without the egg), dry wok chicken, vermicelli salad, and the TWICE COOKED PORK OH MY GOD you have to give this a try at least once. I might cheat on my veganism here and there, and it will likely be to try something new on this menu or get the fish. Anyway, 10/10 love this restaurant.

Although I like hot spicy food, this dish was a little bit too much. Maybe it is ok to share but this dish for one person is a little bit too hot. Plus felt to greasy and fatty for my taste. The waitress did warned me it was hot, I just thought I could handle it hehehe. This restaurant has good reviews, I might have made a poor choice for my taste by selecting this dish, so I will give it a try another day with another option.

The decor is kind of rustic but homey which is nice as well.

FOOD: The food is pretty good! The quality is great as well, especially for a Chinese restaurant. Although some dishes were a bit too salty, the taste was still up there. I got their grilled squid (ok), pad thai (disappointing), broccoli and beef (good), tripe (good) and tofu and seafood pot (good). 

PRICE: Prices are a tad bit expensive in my opinion, especially seeing how it is in a student-friendly area. But I guess for the quality, it's acceptable.

SERVICE: The service was better than most Chinese restaurants. The waitress was friendly and the owners of the restaurants were very welcoming as well.","4 star rating"

On to the food, it was great. Same quality of food as the one in Côtes-des-neiges. By the way, I met the owner, he remembers me. I spoke to him in Mandarin for the first time as well! We took the braised pork with potato noodles. It is one of the popular dishes in the restaurant and our favourite. We also ordered the eggplants, red and yellow peppers with a tofu kind (or vegetable, sorry! I can't remember the name of the veggie). 

Near the closing time, we had a chat about the history of China with the owner of the AuntDai restaurants. 

Overall, if you can ignore the decor, everything is amazingly good. The owner really makes this place as authentic as possible. Apparently, 6 of the dishes are from North of China. You don't need to go to China to have a taste of authentic cuisine. Get them right there!","4 star rating"

This time I was a little disappointed, so maybe I would have been better off eating there. I ordered the pork belly with sweet potato noodles. Good but flavour neutral, which was never the case for this dish. The green beans were as good as always, general tao (for my daughter) a little less perfect.

All of the dishes arrived one by one about 15 minutes after ordering, which really impressed me considering how fast the restaurant was filling up! Every dish we ordered was delicious, the chicken pad thai had a lot of chicken and egg in it which I really enjoyed, and the sauce was tangy and helped bring all the other ingredients to life! The calamari, crab cakes, and tuna tataki were all very impressive dishes, just big enough to enjoy without filling you too quickly.

We were also late and I had called the number and left them a voicemail to advise them & when I got there and mentioned this , the host looked at me weird , which I didn't get why and went to see if they can find us another table since they had given our table away since they thought we were going to be a no show ( since they didn't check the phone msg). 

We got to our table, the waiter was nice and super helpful for the dinner . We had ordered the edamame and chicken gyoza for appetizers. The edamame had a quick since it had a blend of spices to make this Japanese spice & the gyozas were succulent.

Mains : my friends had orders the tofu salad and tartare , and I had ordered the bibimbap. Mine was as expected , delicious & so was the tartare. The only main complaint my friend had was for the the tofu salad as there was barely any tofu in the salad and more of the kale .

Drinks : I ordered a regular mojito ( not the one on the menu but the classic), one friend ordered a non alcoholic mojito & the other didn't order anything to drink. She had wanted an ice tea since she was driving and the bar actually had everything but ice tea , which was a first .

We came on a Monday evening for drinks and some bites to eat. Lots of areas to sit at; we choose the last available high table, the rest had reserved cards on them. Funny enough, no one showed up and they ended up taking all the cards off.

Apparently, they have a ""happy hour"" (from their website) but the only thing on the menu that was on special was three crappy beers. Talk about false advertising. 

- Lucky sangria ($10.00) - nice and summery. They added a few blueberries, oranges, limes and lemons. 
- Lotus ($10.00) - quite ginny but this drink grew on Cbear. She ended up ordering a second one. 
- Edamame ($6.00) - best bang for your buck. Soya sauce was well balanced and added a nice sweetness. There was also some grilled onions and shallots. 
- Chicken dumplings, Thai shrimp and calamari meatballs and beef satay ($27.00) - ordered separately, its $9.75/dish so you save a wee bit ordering 3 or 5 sharing plates. Food was all surprisingly good! Beef satay was very tender, meatballs were stuffed with seafood and dumplings crispy.

Definitely overpriced for what you get but I guess that's to be expected at an Asian fusion place. It was a slow night so we decided to check out a couple other cool spots in the area.","3 star rating"

Unfortunately, I wasn't hungry because I went after having my anniversary dinner with my boyfriend. He wasn't hungry either but we could see what everyone else was eating and it looked so good! The presentation was excellent. We did order some fries just to snack on. They came with some really good spicy mayo and some green onions on top. Really appreciated those. 

My boyfriend also ordered a beer (1664) and he said the beer selection was good.

If you're ever in the area, plan a visit here!

On our first evening in Montreal, we visited Grenade, which was recommended by our host. 
It was a rather slow night, even though a Canadiens game was on. I had a bloody kimchi, which was surprisingly delicious and spicy. I loved it! Later, we had the poutine with pulled pork, the dumplings and the edamame. The edamame was served unexpectedly different than we know it: served in a dressing with sesame seeds.

Don't be fooled by the grunge-y exterior! Once inside you'll see a charming bar surrounded by tables, some with cushions! If you decide to go outside, there's a lovely garden terrasse with lights and plants everywhere! 

We ordered 3 entrees, a main dish, and a side of edamame beans. All of the dishes arrived one by one about 15 minutes after ordering, which really impressed me considering how fast the restaurant was filling up! Every dish we ordered was delicious, the chicken pad thai had a lot of chicken and egg in it which I really enjoyed, and the sauce was tangy and helped bring all the other ingredients to life! The calamari, crab cakes, and tuna tataki were all very impressive dishes, just big enough to enjoy without filling you too quickly. The edamame beans were tossed in a soy based sauce and caramelized onions, which I had not seen done before. And guess what: LOVED it!

We were also late and I had called the number and left them a voicemail to advise them & when I got there and mentioned this , the host looked at me weird , which I didn't get why and went to see if they can find us another table since they had given our table away since they thought we were going to be a no show ( since they didn't check the phone msg). 

We got to our table, the waiter was nice and super helpful for the dinner . We had ordered the edamame and chicken gyoza for appetizers. The edamame had a quick since it had a blend of spices to make this Japanese spice & the gyozas were succulent.

Mains : my friends had orders the tofu salad and tartare , and I had ordered the bibimbap. Mine was as expected , delicious & so was the tartare. The only main complaint my friend had was for the the tofu salad as there was barely any tofu in the salad and more of the kale .

Drinks : I ordered a regular mojito ( not the one on the menu but the classic), one friend ordered a non alcoholic mojito & the other didn't order anything to drink. She had wanted an ice tea since she was driving and the bar actually had everything but ice tea , which was a first . 

The reason why it's a 3 star is not solely based on the drink selection, but mainly how we were greeted and dealt with at the beginning. I would definitely go back eventually to try again when it isn't raining","3 star rating"

We came on a Monday evening for drinks and some bites to eat. Lots of areas to sit at; we choose the last available high table, the rest had reserved cards on them. Funny enough, no one showed up and they ended up taking all the cards off.

Apparently, they have a ""happy hour"" (from their website) but the only thing on the menu that was on special was three crappy beers. Talk about false advertising.

Not authentic at all but I guess for a bar that is to be expected. Pad Thai was flavourless and honestly Thai express does it better :/ the snacks to share are super pricy for what they are, it was 10$ for 3 tiny satay skewers, and another 10$ for 4 tiny pieces of popcorn chicken on a small bed of rice.

According to the groom, who spent the entirety of the night trying to get the things they had asked for in advance, he called them 4 times and every time the bar seemed to doubt that the wedding would show up at all...hence the lack of preparations? It was near impossible to get drinks and they were very rude. At one point later in the evening me and two of my friends were being aggressively harassed by an extremely drunk man, and not one BUT TWO people who worked at the bar walked by looked at us standing there helplessly being yelled at and walked away, doing nothing.

Snooty and slow - servers were ""busy"" on their phones. Pricing system is overly complex and about $2-3 too high per dish relative to portion size. They also refuse substitutions. 

That said, the Korean fried chicken and pork belly bun were both pretty standout. And the drinks were solid (especially nice to see some thoughtful and complex virgin drink options - as the designated driver I usually get the shaft but not here!)

Be aware, if you're planning to try a few small plates and order more later, the sizes are very small and you might incur a 20-30min wait time for each round. They also won't honour the 3-plate / 5-plate deals unless all the dishes are ordered at the same time. (No warning unless you ask.)

There was a cool fire pit occupied by some patrons so we sat in the middle. Ironically there was a disco ball hanging from the back but it actually didn't seem awkward at all. Cool ambience with lots of locals in the ""industry""
We shared a pitcher of the ""Lucky Sangria"" which was definitely not sangria- had quite the twist to it- made with sake, ginger beer and vodka amongst the mix. Definitely had a kick to it but was very good. Easy to chat and relax. Did not have food there but the menu did look appealing. 
Service was good- waitress friendly and talkative. Would go there again. It is in the Village so would definitely look it up if not staying in the area.

First of all the meals were prepared very quickly, the portions were of a good size and all of them tasted amazing.

Had a small sized spicy coconut soup with chicken. It arrived super warm and no need to heat it up. It was super nice and creamy and had a good amount of chicken in it.

Next we had the general tao and the phaw sew to share. The general tao was nice and crispy, good portion and good quality meat inside. The phaw sew however was my favourite, lots of flavour and if you like garlic you will love it too.

Overall great value, depending on how hungry you are you could definitely have left overs for the next day. Also tons of fish and vegetarian options.","5 star rating"

The spring roll was made of super thick rice paper, and it was mostly filled with vermicelli instead of vegetables and proteins.

I never go to monkland village, but the neighborhood is quite lively.

At first, looking at the menu, it seems quite unremarkable, it seems to be Thai food with a twist, some ingredients added, some omitted, or presented in a different way.

I guess we can call it neo Thai. Eventhough it's not pure thai, I found the taste of the dishes to be good, it was well balanced with salty, sweet and spicy.

We had papaya salad, thom kha soup, pad thai, and stir fry chicken chow mein, and spring rolls.

When I looked at the salad there was no dried shrimp in it (fresh shrimp instead), but it tasted fine, it was well made and I'm not sure i missed the shrimps... also the carrots and papaya were shredded very thin so it made it easy to eat and light.

The spring rolls were fine, (mine are better :P but I'm not selling hihi). The pad thai was good, a bit on the sweet side but a splash of lime fixed that. The soup again had some weird ingredients like brocoli but heh it tasted fine, tangy with sweet smell of coconut milk yummy...

All in all, it was a good find, and very tasty!!!

It seems to be always busy which is a good sign.
The restaurant is clean and welcoming, and has elements of authentic Thailand, but it's not an obviously Thai restaurant.
As a vegetarian I love that they have the veggie options already on the menu.
The service was very friendly and helpful but slow.
I ordered the steamed tofu & vegetable dish with steamed rice and truly enjoyed every bite. My fiancé tried the peanut chicken and she seemed to love it.
Food is very affordable. Portions look huge but truthfully not as big as some other places.
Only getting 3 stars because service was a bit slow and food could have been a touch more flavourful, but definitely worth going to again.

We ordered the Pad Thai along with Tom Yum soup and both were far from satisfying. The Pad Thai was bland and the soup was painful to eat with shrimp that tasted like rubber and a broth that reminded me of soapy dish water.

We arrived at 5:57 p.m. on a Friday evening (I got a phone call as I was walking in and that is how I could track time) with 4 kids ages from 4 to 9. We sat on the lovely terrace and ordered within 10 minutes. We explained to the waiter that one of my daughters is vegetarian so she chose 3 appetizers instead of a meal. They brought 25 minutes later her spring roll, pb dumplings but not the soup. We waited OVER AN HOUR to get the rest of the food. Everyone around us who walked in after us, ordered and got their food before us. My kids were very hungry after a long day at school. We kept asking our waiter what is going on and he apologized and all he said was that it will take longer. 
50 minutes after we ordered, my husband wanted to walk out, but decided to go inside and inquire one last time what is going on. He saw that 2 of our dishes and the soup were ready and that they were holding them. He asked them to please bring them out. They did. My kids were so hungry, they shared and ate too fast and then we had a lot of leftovers as they could not eat the rest of the dishes that arrived even later. 
Before we left I asked to speak to the manager. Her customer approach was very argumentative, with a tone, and not apologetic at all. She said that for Friday night 45 minutes to 1 hour is a regular wait. I asked her why did the rest of the people around us, who came later than us, got their food before us, including friends of our kids from school who sat at the next table, ordered 5 minutes before us (they were 4 people) got their meals, ate, paid and left while we didn't get anything? She went on, arguing again (with a tone), that because my daughter ordered the appetizers they waited for her to finish them before they brought the meal. I explained to her that we told our waiter that the appetizers were for one child instead of a meal and that she eats slowly (she didn't even finish the soup and shared the dumplings and spring roll with her siblings) so why didn't he explain this to us before, when we kept inquiring, we would have told him to bring out everything together - he was just saying he is sorry it is taking so long. She also said that if we decide to give them a second chance we should make sure to tell the waiter to bring all the food at the same time. How and when did it become our fault??
I told her that I would expect her to be more understanding and apologetic, maybe offer us some comp drinks or desert - she looked at me like I was crazy but then gave us a 10% discount for next time - as if there will be a next time.
We were all VERY DISAPPOINTED (to put it nicely and mildly) with the service and the way the manager handled (or did not handle) the situation.","1 star rating"

My wife and I were regulars to the point where all I had to say when I called is ""It's Rob"" and they knew my order, and it was delicious too.

Now, all I get is attitude and meh food. 

Went to night to pick up my food and it took a while for a waitress to come to cash (even though at least 5 people were behind the counter). She told me the orders waiting were delivery and someone would help me, even though I told her it had been 50 minutes since I ordered and food should be ready (she wasn't concerned).
It took at least another solid 5 minutes until someone came to help me, and low-and-behold my order had been sitting there the whole time.
I told him how upset I was about the poor service and how long it took, but it did not phase him or seem to matter.

Very, very disappointed in the service AND the food. 
This used to be a great neighborhood joint - time to find a new one, I'm thinking.","1 star rating"

Everything is just regular. Their pad thai is alright. Definitely better than fast food thai (like Thai Express) but not by too much. Luckily it is not overly salty. If anything, it needed more salt and flavor. I would probably recommend getting a dish with shrimp as it would suit the flavors better.

I have heard people rave about it but I don't know what the hype is about. Even the entrees are nothing to speak about. Overrated is the key word here, folks.

If you're looking for some good Thai food, and don't mind being in a food court area, go to Bangkok located in the Faubourg downtown (near Guy street, on St-Catherine).","2 star rating"

The first impression that I had with the restaurant is that, for the price point of the menu, they've definitely seated way too many people in the dining room. Chairs approach the front door and it's just a little bit too loud.

As an entree, I ordered the Peanut Butter Dumplings for my friend and I to share. The dumplings are wonton soup-style wontons covered in a watery peanut butter sauce. They we're definitely edible but definitely not stellar. Peanut butter is usually a safe bet too...

I had the Garlic Shrimp. The vegetables and shrimp tasted fresh, but the dish itself wasn't more than the sum of its parts.

I ordered a lychee slushie too; probably the best part of my meal. This place would be great if the bill didn't make me feel like I overpaid. There is nothing wrong with running a noodle shop but I want to pay a fair price too.","3 star rating"

Tonight we waited 50 minutes for our food. We asked the waitress what was going on and she told us it was busy. However, there were several patrons around us who had arrived after us eating their main courses while we were still waiting for our appetizer!

I used to live in this neighbourhood years ago and was back in the area and stopped in for a quick bite to eat. It was only 5pm so there was only one other family there and yet it took forever to be greeted and shown a table (the woman behind the cash knew I was there but never bothered to make eye contact). Eventually someone else came around and showed me a seat.  I noticed the table (and those around me) didn't seem super clean...it wasn't dirty either, but kind of what you would expect in a budget restaurant (much like the plastic cup my water was served in). I ordered chicken with peanut sauce. Normally I would also order imperial rolls but the prices were too high, I wasn't willing to spend that much. My meal came in a timely manner but the sauce was way too salty. The chicken pieces were really big but I wasn't given a knife, just a fork and spoon (mind you, I didn't ask for one). A few bites of chicken were kind of gross, like with chewy bits of tendon. The meal wasn't entirely awful, but it wasn't good either, and the whole experience definitely a disappointment.

As far as the food, it was very good tasting.;  Much better quality than I expected, fresh and clean tasting.  I had the basil beef dish as a main and it was great.  The green curry chicken wasn't too bad either and the spring rolls were obviously just made as we ordered.  I also had crispy duck as an appetizer and it was very good as well.

Service, however, was a little lacking.  There seemed to be enough staff but they were very slow.  In fact one of our appetizers was cold, and I'm pretty sure it was meant to be hot!

All in all pretty good.  The bill was only about $85 or so for two including a bottle of wine so I really can't complain!

The meat pieces were large and the portion size was def. good. The bun bo hue had a goood spice kick to it and I appreciated how deep the flavors are, as most places do not do the soup justice. We also got a side of spring rolls, which were the standard, but how can we not order spring rolls in our Viet meal?? 

Def. check this place out.","5 star rating"

The food taste was fine but not the best. Having tried several other vietnamese places in Montreal, I would definitely be inclined to other options. The place is also not super clean.

I wanted pho and found one of the few places still open, Pho Bac 97. It's located a few doors down from Nouilles de Lan Zhou. 

We dropped in on a Thursday evening (around 9:30pm). The place got a crazy last minute rush then died off again.

The menu is split into appetizers, pho, rice vermicelli, rice (grilled and sautéed), combos and dessert. For the pho, you choose between three sizes (small, medium and XL). 

- Goi cuon (#1) ($4.50) - shrimp and vegetable spring rolls. It would have been decent except they used cheap quality, shredded lettuce that tasted off. 
- Bun bo xao sa (hoac ga) (#24) ($11.50) - beef sautéed with lemongrass on vermicelli and salad. Looked pretty typical but CC enjoyed it. 
- Com ga nuong (#26) ($13.00) - grilled chicken, rice and salad. Cbear didn't touch the salad but I don't blame her. Grilled chicken and rice looked plain.
- Bun bo hue (#16) ($10.50 medium) - the broth was incredibly salty. 100% MSG. Not much depth or spiciness to their BBH. Super disappointing.

We heard that Montreal had a really good Viet scene and decided to check this hole in the wall place out. 

Like most reviews, don't expect much in the way of service here. But the food was actually quite good. We ordered the standard Large Special Pho, which is #5 on the menu. The bowl was quite large. It filled me up pretty good. Coming from NYC where we can get very good Pho this place is pretty much neck and neck with some of the good ones in NYC. The meat was sufficiently portioned for a large bowl. You get the raw beef round and also the cooked beef brisket that has some fat and nice flavor. They also give plenty of garnish to go with it all including scallions, cilantro, Thai basil, bean sprouts, lemon and even a chili pepper (be careful with the pepper).

But what makes a Pho good is also the broth. This one was very meaty in flavor and savory at just the right amount. The noodles were cooked right and aldente. The broth could have been a bit more hot in my opinion. But other than that it was a winner in my book. Hit all the right notes and was warm and comforting for someone with tired legs in chilly weather.

Another plus while we were there was a bunch of Vietnamese people eating there and really e
enjoying the food. If their own people eat there, that's a really good sign.

I wouldn't mind going back to try their spring rolls, summer rolls and other family style plates as well.

All in all a good meal and reasonably priced. Walked out full and satisfied, the two of us, for just $24 (with tip included).","4 star rating"

Honestly, the overall experience was pretty disappointing. I have tried Vermicelli Noodles in multiple places in Montreal so far, but the one I had there was the worst. First of all, the tea they served at the beginning tasted like colored warm water with no flavor at all. Then they mistakenly served me grilled pork vermicelli instead of chicken. When I asked if that was chicken (which certainly didn't look like chicken) they changed it, but didn't apologize for it at all. And lastly, I was utterly disappointed when I got a hair in my noodle bowl.  Overall, it wasn't a pleasant experience.

The broth was GOOD! You could see that the beef slices were raw and cooked in boiling pho broth, which is how it should be. The only disappointment is the noodles, which were dry packaged noodles and not freshly made.

Located in the center of Chinatown, it's a cheap little Vietnamese restaurant that offers pho and other Vietnamese dishes that you can find at other Vietnamese restaurants. Nothing fancy, fluorescent lights and kind of a bare bones service. 

We were seated right away and brought lovely jasmine tea like the kind that is served at Chinese restaurants. After looking over the menu, a man came by to take our orders without writing anything down. I ordered a medium pho, which ended up being a dollar cheaper than the small, but too much food for me to finish.

I also ordered a spring roll, which here, means the unfried rice paper roll filled with bean spouts, vermicelli noodles, the white parts of lettuce and shrimp. The peanut sauce that it was served with was good, but I've had better rolls. Oh and by the way, they're called ""summer rolls"" where I'm from if you're more familiar with that term. 

I asked a waiter (?) for water and he didn't even acknowledge me, but another man brought us waters.... we had to go up to the cash register to pay. If the service was better, this place would be better than a-ok, but for now, it's just 3 stars in my book.","3 star rating"

I attempted to  be adventurous and try a different dish based on the image #1 posted on yelp which for sure was photoshopped and didn't exactly represent the dish.

I ordered #25 which is a beef vermicelli bowl with spring rolls and some lettuce and it came with a small soup as well. My friend ordered the same thing as I did but the chicken version. We were both happy with the soup but disappointed with the beef and chicken vermicelli bowl. It lacked color, taste and maybe the fact that I had a better version of this dish elsewhere makes me a tougher critique. 

Long story short they make a delicious beef pho soup and in my opinion this would be the best item on the menu to order. Stay away from their vermicelli bowl.","3 star rating"

Based on the reviews on Yelp, I decided on Pho Bac because it was very close, had great reviews, and looked exactly like that hole-in-the-wall place that serves authentic fare without all the pretension.

And that's exactly what we got!  The perfect recipe for pho on a Friday night in Montreal.

We arrived just before 8, and the place was hopping.  I was afraid we wouldn't get a table, but a group cleared out just as we arrived, and we were able to get a table.  It was crowded... but it made for a great atmosphere.  I would venture to say that a lot of the customers were locals.  

I ordered Pho Ga as per my usual routine when at a Vietnamese place, and my friend ordered the vegetarian small soup.  She also ordered some fresh spring rolls.  Tea was complimentary.

My pho was the best chicken pho I'd ever tasted.  I'm being completely honest with this when I say the best.  The cuts of chicken were good.  A mix of mostly white meat and some dark pieces.  The meat wasn't overly fatty, but you could tell that the broth had been cooked with just enough fat to give it a distinct flavor without being greasy.  I loved it.  The mix of vegetables was minimal, some onion a spring of cilantro.... with the sprouts and thai basil and lime wedge, the flavor was perfect.  The temperature, too, was excellent.  Hot, but not too hot that I couldn't dig in right away. I ordered a medium and it was plenty big, my friend's small was probably the perfect portion size to be honest.

Got the first item on the menu, which was the mixed beef noodle. 
Meat was drab with no flavour. Didn't really taste fresh so I don't recommend the rare beef noodle. Broth wasn't extremely hot so I don't know if it all cooked down. The tripe was kinda meh as well. 
Good points though: Broth was authentic, and noodle texture was also on point.
Usually I get vermicelli at pho places so I might go again and try that? Vermicelli usually comes fully cooked and warm/cold so you don't have to worry about the issues found in the pho here.

bowl. The serving was small and the beef was so tough that we could not chew and had to spit it out.

I have had pho from many Viet restaurants, and somehow there is no clear distinction on what okay or great pho is since it all basically tastes the same. The only distinction would be the soup base. The soup base is very clear and refreshing, which I really liked. I am very used to pho that has full of flavor and it makes me thirsty after every few bites. - If you really enjoy your soup base to be very clear with just enough flavor, this is the place to go. It was not salty at all, compared to many other pho places I have had especially in NYC. 

The spring roll definitely differs from the ones in NYC, I'm not sure whether it is just the way this restaurant or Montreal Vietnamese restaurant makes it, but it simply tastes the same but with larger spring roll wrap. 

One downside is the ice coffee that I ordered was packed with ice and it was completely gone after a few sips. It is definitely disappointing when I can't even enjoy my meal with my coffee. 

I can totally see everybody that works there are very kind people despite the low attentive service.","4 star rating"

If you happen to be offered a pot of fragrant tea and a menu you may even order a bunch more. Since it was between meals, it was just the former 2.

Unfortunately, the rolls were below expectations and I've had my fair share of 4 and 5 star semi translucent wrapped Vietnamese spring rolls of the freshest kind. Sometimes the green onion is sticking out the end, sometimes they are thicker and more chock full of plump bean sprouts and the shrimp are moist and flavourful. 

In this case the bean sprouts were brown at the ends, the roll was shriveled and dry looking, plus sadly the shrimp were dry and had not been cleaned properly. 

Perhaps, it was between lunch and dinner and they had sat a while. Perhaps, I was too focused on them as my main snack, yet something said, 'nope, this ain't right'. I expressed these shortcomings, (did not mention the place smelling not so good), and was told that was normal. I mentioned my numerous other good experiences and decided to move right along.

I can see the average rating for this place is pretty decent, so I wonder if it was bad timing? I don't give many 2's, but for the spring rolls and smell under the table, this simply reflects that.","2 star rating"

I usually order the special along side a plate of fresh shrimp rolls and it never disappoints.  The food comes out super quick and the steaming bowl of pho is always on point!  The give generous amounts of meat and other goodies including tendon, tripe, beef balls, etc. in their special and the extra large is definitely going to fill you up.  You can probably use the bowl to wash your face after, it's so large.

Being from DC, I have quite a pho palate and this place fails miserably. Let's start off with the good:
- the place has quick service.  You are in an out within 30 minutes. 
- the portions are large.  A medium size bowl is a large in some other places.  

Now onto the disappointment:
- cash only. It's expected in these types of restaurants but can be inconvenient for tourists. 
- the pho broth was greasy, a huge pet peeve of mine. The cuts of meat were also extremely fatty.  Some pieces were all fat.  Gross.  
- the broth was also very bland. I had to add a ton of hoisin and sriracha in order to get any type of flavor.  
- the summer rolls are bean sprouts, shredded lettuce, and slices of thin shrimp. The dipping sauce was watery.  

Overall I would not come back.  Pho is all about broth and a greasy, fatty, unflavored broth is a big no no.","2 star rating"

The chef uses chicken broth in their vegetable pho. There is a vegetable crispy noodle stir fry on the menu but unfortunately the noodles are prepared with eggs in them. My server offered to give me vermicelli instead, but when my dish arrived, the rice noodles were not integrated into the dish. Instead they were served in a cold lump in a separate bowl. The only truly vegan item on the menu is a vegetable spring roll. It lacked tofu, had poor quality iceberg lettuce and was accompanied by a dipping sauce that was largely vinegar with some floating peanuts on top. Very disappointing meal.

This is my first visit in Montreal. The beef noodle soup broth didn't seem to have a lot of msg. It tasted like most of the vietnamese restaurants I've tried. There was a hand full of Vietnamese restaurants but this was the best option. This place got selected since it was the only one I notice that had customers eating. 

The soup in the a separate container was filled all the way up which was not good for putting stuff in when you don't have a separate bowl. They put the noodle and raw meat in one container and the broth in another so they seem to be aware of the noodles getting soggy.","4 star rating"

Soup arrived quickly.  The flavor was *brilliant*.  The noodles in it had the best texture of any Asian soup noodles I've ever eaten.  Only complaint about the soup was the scarcity of beef.

Choice of four sauces/condiments on the table, along with a rack of chopsticks and spoons, and an old school napkin-dispenser (wish more places would think of that), caused that I lacked for nothing logistics-wise.   Pleasant meal.

Restroom was a bit dirty, but fully-functional. Points for that. You're lucky to get a door that locks, in a lot of Chinatown's places.

It was -15C / 5F out so we blazed our way here for a warm bowl of pho. My preference is pho ga (chicken), and after having a bowl of pho ga with beef broth at one place and another place that didn't have any chicken broth, I was very excited when the waiter gave me a ""of course, we have chicken broth!"" look. Third times a charm. 

After taking my first sip of my soup, ahhh, it hit the spot!  I was a little disappointed that I'd had whiffs of bleach even after the usual ritual wipe down of utensils. They also didn't have coriander. Cilantro and pho ga go together like salt on fries. It just gives it that extra umph. 

Nevertheless, the meat portions are generous and the soup is hearty. I've had way worse and better ones.

The atmosphere was blah, but the food was tres yum. 

I tried the beef pho, a chicken curry and the spring rolls. The pho was served in huge portions, so unless your stomach is able to hold more than a gallon of soup I'd suggest sizing way down. The prices were reasonable. and the food was hot and good. The chicken curry was spicier (and therefore more delicious) than I'd first anticipated.

The spring rolls were disappointing for 2 reasons. The first being that they came out 30 seconds before the rest of the food, leaving us no time to eat them, and the second is that I really just didn't like the taste of these spring rolls and I can't put my finger on why. They were bland and just not what I wanted. What I wanted was a fried spring roll, and I didn't realize these weren't fried. They were also huge, each the size of a small burrito.

As with most Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown/International District locales, the seating is humble, the restrooms are dirty, the service is decent, and you would be wise to wipe down your eating utensils prior to using them.  This is par for the course, and indeed, I feel less than comfortable eating a dish in a fancy place when it is traditionally served from stools on the ground.  

So forget all that.  How's the food?

The Pho broth here has an initial rich, floral scent and taste, but unfortunately, it doesn't last.  The aftertaste tastes strongly of MSG and lacks anise and a good meat base.  

The noodles were oddly cool compared to the soup.  Not undercooked, mind you.  And certainly not overcooked to the point of bursting and falling apart.  

The variety of meats was good.  They could have been sliced more thinly.  

The garnishes were decent, with lime, bean sprouts, and Thai basil.  Pho places get extra points in my book when they include culantro (""ngo gai"").  The vegetables seemed quite fresh and fragrant.  

So all in all, Pho Bac 97 is a pretty good place.  Perhaps I had an off-day, but I was their first customer that day, so doubtful.","3 star rating"

The food is incredible, the staff is extremely nice, and the price is right.

I always order combination B1, but with fresh shrimp spring rolls instead of imperial rolls (they are very accommodating here).  This combination includes strips of tender chicken sauteed with lemongrass and chili with sticky white rice, fresh shrimp spring rolls with two fantastic dipping sauces, and a spectacular Vietnamese beef and vermicelli soup.

Every one of these things is out of this world.  The lemongrass chicken is tender, succulent, and just a tad bit spicy.  This is served with crisp veggies and perfectly cooked sticky white rice that provides a nice antidote to the spice.  The shrimp spring rolls are fresh, flavourful, and  paired with both a sweet vinegary sauce with carrots and cabbage and a homemade sweet and crunchy peanut sauce so crazy good you'll want to dip everything into it.  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, the beef soup ('Tonkinoise' in French) is perhaps the most delicious thing of all: a generous portion of incredibly tender, wonderfully flavorful beef strips floating in a jaw-dropping lemongrass broth with crisp green onions, soft vermicelli noodles and fresh cilantro.

It isn't fancy, but Pho Bac is definitely worth making a special trip for.","5 star rating"

I went there around 16h on a Friday in November. The restaurant was little dark and not clean, I saw some little garbages on the floor and some tables weren't cleaned up even though place wasn't full. We 4 people, ordered a big chicken pho, a big beef pho ( both were huge enough to share with 2 ) and a spring rolls ( not fried ). Spring rolls were just ok. Really, nothing special nor impressive, you can make them just like that at home. 
Pho was good, but weren't that hot as I wanted to be and I wanted them to have more flavor or salt even, I felt that soup was lack of salt or some taste even though it had a nice flavor. And also I wanted more chicken in a chicken pho, even though beef pho had a good amount of beef. 
So, to sum It up, I guess i'm not coming back. If you try to make nice pho by yourself checking recipes online, you'll be able to make them just like them.","3 star rating"

I guess they were closing soon too, as the entire restaurant smelled of bleach and cleaning products.  No matter - I was about to eat my first ever bowl of pho.  I can't compare it to anything else, but it was really delicious.  I overdid it on the chili sauce but I knew I couldn't let anything go to waste.  So, even though I was sweating profusely into my bowl, I finished it and had no regrets.  It took about 12 hours for my taste-buds to get back to normal after being destroyed by the chili sauce.  Again, no regrets.","4 star rating"

We walked in on a cold afternoon to warm up and nurse some pretty bitchin' hangovers. The menu was the same as any other pho restaurant, order by number. They brought out the typical plate of basil, lime and bean sprouts as we sat there shivering and sweating simultaneously. 

I don't know what kind of liquid crack they put in their pho, but it was seriously, deliriously tasty and full of flavor! We licked those large bowls clean and wanted to beg for more, had we not already been so stuffed and satisfied.

Pho Bac 97 isn't as good in flavors or clean. Not to be a snotty brat but it only made sense that when us three Queens girls treck it over here to Montreal's Chinatown but only from St. Denis (no biggie) to try this place (all over the tour books) we weren't too impressed.

I believe the Sriracha and Fish sauce were in containers too... so no squirt bottle action.  

The decor made me feel like I was in a sad hardworking Alaskan family's restaurant. I can't imagine it in the Summer.

None of us got the vermicelli or rice plates but the only way I could explain it is that if those other spots I mentioned boiled their broth for 5+ hours then this place only did 2... 

So if you're far from this location .. I'm pretty sure any other Vietnamese place around town will be the same.

This is the problem when you don't do any advanced research on restaurants before you go to a destination. Plus, when you ask people on the street for pho and they aren't Asian, they automatically send you to the local Chinatown. Oh well, lesson learnt. 

I looked up this place on the Yelp app on the crackberry. It came up and it looked okay. I actually was intrigued by Annie P.'s review on this place about the Asian party. We were hoping that the Asian gangster would give us four Asian brethren ideas on where the fun places were to go. But that didn't happen. Obviously the kind of party they were offering Annie P. isn't the kind of party we're invited to. 

The place is like any other standard Pho place. All of them have the standard white lacquer table and dinner chairs with the plasticy chopsticks and spoons sitting at the table. 

Ordered the Pho Dac Biet; the usual I get at any pho restaurant. The food came fast...standard. 

The soup was frickin hot, but unfortunately I can't say that the flavor was anything worthwhile. Was a little disappointed. We were craving some good pho after a few days of the gnarly rubbish the locals called food. We were hoping for an Asian saving grace in some local pho, but no joy. 

Well, it was filling and standard in price like $6 USD. It is in the heart of Chinatown (given that their Chinatown is like 2 square blocks). And of course China and Vietnam are the same.... right..... 

There were a couple places across the street that looked to be more popular by number of people in them, but they were all Caucasian with a couple Asians, so not sure if they were any good. 

My suggestion is to just find the one with the most or best looking Asian people and eat there. That way you'll at least get the pleasure of being with others with a similar taste profile and can maybe get that hookup to a nice Asian party in the area.","2 star rating"

I had the chicken, and my father had the beef, and they were both great. We also tried the shrimp spring rolls (not the fried kind, the kind that's often called ""summer rolls"") and they were great as well. They used iceberg lettuce though, and it was a little wilted.

The pandan sour drink seems to be one of their most popular drinks, and for good reason -- it's got ingredients that you wouldn't ever think to combine in a drink and yet it works so, so well: rum, pandan syrup, lime, egg white, and then powdered cranberry, powdered seaweed, cardamom. Magical. Every drink is something special. 

The best, best thing are the mixologists here. We sat at the bar, right where Mackenzie was mixing up drinks. Mackenzie made us some kind of shooter with sake, pink peppercorn syrup and an orange liquer that was deeeelicious. We also interacted with Antoine. Both these guys clearly love what they do, are crazy talented at it, and were having so much fun throughout the night (eg dancing around). This made it really fun for us too. I honestly cannot rave about them enough.

Atmosphere: loud yet cozy, super atmospheric - the ceiling is covered in lanterns and they pump in fog so the place is slightly reminiscent of an opium den (in a good way).

Came here on a Saturday night at 1am and stayed til closing.","5 star rating"

As soon as you walk in you have the choice to go upstairs where there is a restaurant or  downstairs where its a lounge bar.

We went downstairs to the lounge area, it has lanterns suspended all over from the ceiling. It has a very chic asian flair and all drinks are  asian inspired. Great presentation. Very hip place after 11pm great DJ, place can fet packed pretty fast so I suggest you go a bit early so you can have a seated spot or you can reserve in advance.

Opened since Feb. 2018- the set up here reminds me of David Schmitz's, Le Mal Nécessaire in Chinatown, with an ongoing theme of an underground Asian inspired tiki bar. The decor is a Vietnamese botanical Garden - Asian lanterns hanging from the ceiling, bar seats and leather couches, the dim light sets the tone.

The bar is a strong highlight displaying crystal canisters with dry ingredients. The drinks average around 14$ individually or 40$ for a huge drink for 2! (Pink fighter is adorable!) I had the pleasure of chatting with my bartender, Max, who has bartended in previous venues like Mimi la Nuit. He made me a Dji (5/5) a spin off of an old fashioned with mezcal, tequila, pineapple, chanterelles and beurre noisette bitters (a French syrup often used in cooking). It was great!!! The second drink-Indo China Punch (4/5) was an interesting suggestion ft. 4 elements: booze, sweet, sour and H2O explained Max. Oolong tea, cardamom, honey, citrus and a base of your choice of alcohol: Gin, vodka, aperol or mezcal. All these ingredients are then clarified by a hot Goat's Whey-very cool! 

For food there is a selection of a few items - I tried the Beef Tataki salad (3/5) which had some nice elements: like the crab chips and peanuts for a crunch. The beef was hidden in this dish-which should be the main attraction. Le Red tiger still holds strong competition on their beef Tataki dish!

I liked that the venue didn't get crowded to maximum capacity - it is a nice environment for afterwork drinks, girls night or a date!","5 star rating"

I also shared the crispy tofu and salmon tartare and both were delicious! Some variety in the menu of drinks but the menu for food was quite small. being a bar in the Old Port, it is not cheap.

The line was long but we were quickly accommodated at the bar where two spots opened up. The venue is quite loud for speakeasy; The long wraparound bar and seating booths along the wall would make it more a lounge bar. The Asian inspired décor definitely makes this venue different.  The drink menu is great offering cocktails for all tastes and if not, the knowledgeable drink masters can definitely whip something up for you! Being a rum drinker, I tried a few of their cocktails (one off menu) and besides one that includes liquid smoke, I chugged those babies back!

The decor is beautiful , very cozy and chic with lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The staff was so friendly , our server gave us some great recommendations and was super pleasant and efficient. We didn't taste the food yet since we were just going for drinks but they do serve some food (which is smaller bites from the restaurant upstairs) but I peaked over at the next table who did order some and it looked very good ! Great spot to hangout with some friends or for a date , the atmosphere is fun and lively. After a certain time they have their DJ on site and I have to say the music was great and it really just added to the overall vibe. They have a tiki style cocktail theme going with great original cocktails that they specialize in , with very interesting exotic and of course delicious flavours with great presentation. They even have jumbo cocktails served in awesome looking ways to share for two or more. The prices weren't dirt cheap but not over the top either, I would say they're on par or maybe a little less expensive than other places in the area. That being said there is a lot of care put into the mixology, the presentation, the ambience and the customer service so I think it's worth the money !

I didn't try any food so please take this review with a grain of salt and consider the context: I love having more small, cool, fun, friendly bars in old Montreal and this one it's a beaut. I love ducking downstairs into a dim sexy basement with warm glowing lanterns. I loved the kind staff, the bartender who took the time to check in and chat while smoothly mixing multiple drinks. The drinks and vibe are kind of Vietnamese Tiki, and that's a fun twist and day. Cocktails are priced the way you'd expect for old Montreal mixology with tiki bar ware.

We got there at 9:40pm, waited at the door a little and no one came to see us so we figured we had to sit ourselves. We sat down, and no one came to see us for about 10 min, after what my boyfriend decided to go grab a menu himself. 
At around 10, my friends arrived and we were all ready to order. 
My friends went to see the waiter twice (!) to ask him if we could order and he said he was coming.
He finally came to the table at around 10:15pm, we ordered, and I got some food because I was starving. 
The waiter came back 5 min later to tell me the kitchen had closed, even tho it was before kitchen closing time (10:30). 
But remember I've been there since 9:40pm, waiting for him to come see me.
I've been working in a restaurant for 5 years and I would never ever offer a service this bad!!!
He didn't apologize properly, didn't offer shots on the house to apologize or anything. He rly seemed like he didn't really care.
I was really disappointed, and my night got spoiled since I arrived.

It's the hidden bar / speakeasy under HA. Both share the same menu (kind of) but one thing to note for all you bao lovers, Nhau doesn't have the steamed buns. However, they make it up with the fried broccoli (i'm not usually a fan of fried food but this dish is a must), the papaya salad (so rich in flavors), and the salmon tartare. Now let's talk drinks, I definitely believe that the bar tender is talented. They taste bomb, but watch out, you may get addicted to the taste and lose count on # glasses! My fav are the dji and the indochino. Beyond food, the main reason I go there is the music, a loungy deep house in a dark romantic atmospher.

I lived in Thailand for a couple of years way back when so I know Thai food pretty well, from the awesome street food you can get EVERYWHERE to the upscale fusion type places that cost a pretty penny (frankly not worth it except for air conditioning and ambience since the small shop/street food is so damn good).

That makes me picky.

So to my review: if you want Thai food that is anywhere close to authentic do not bother with this place. You will get better for cheaper at just about any Thai Express.

We ordered to go the Tom Yum Keung (shrimp), Kaeng Phet Gai (chicken in red coconut curry), and some Pat See Ewe (flat noodles in brown sauce with beef).

Granted I did not specify how spicy these should be. I forgot. But they did not ask! In that case the default should be Thai medium which is western pretty damn spicy but not intolerable except for the faint of palate. 

The Tom Yum was quite literally the worst I have ever tasted. It tasted like lightly used dishwater infused with an insipid thin tomato soup (like they took a teaspoon of Campbell's tomato soup and added it to a pint of cloudy water. NOTHING like the explosion of exquisite spices and flavors wrapped around a galanga / lemon grass base with a ton of shrimp chilli paste. It is not actually supposed to be eaten like a soup but rather eaten with rice as you would any other curry. This seems odd to the uninitiated because it is so thin, but trust me that is how it is....just like Filipino 'soups'. Even the mild is pretty spicy, or should be. That's why you need the rice.

The red curry was a nice enough base but there was not ONE traditionally thai vege in there. It should be loaded with these mini little eggplants and a few other things like basil leaves, onions etc. Instead it was bulked out with green bell pepper. This is not even a traditional Thai vegetable, but rather an import that is grown in the mountains up in the North of Thailand. I never saw one bell pepper in Bangkok in 2 years of living there except in western restaurants. Worse...I HATE bell peppers. Love chillis of any variety....go figure. The chicken was dried out too. Waste of calories.

Last but not least, the Pat See Ewe: this was passable at best. Or it would have been had they used the right noodles and made it a tad more moist. The noodles were too narrow and for whatever reason they mashed it all up like they were feeding it to a five year old. Also not enough egg in there and barely any beef.

I would have given it one star but I reserve that honour for only the truly terrible in terms of service as well as food. In fact I have only ever given one star and that was to that idiot down in the Old Port who thankfully i can't remember any more.

In short if you are looking for Thai food, don't waste your time or money. If however you are looking for ok tasting NOT-Thai food, maybe you will like it as some other reviewers obviously did.","2 star rating"

But last night was not so great. It was VERY disappointing. We had the ""table d'hôte"" with soup, mango salad, spring roll, rice and our main dish. It cost 45$ for 2 and was not worth the price. 

The soup (Tom Yum) was good; good flavours, but the ingredients inside it where cheap compared to the amazing soup I had years ago. It contained coarsely chopped tomatoes and mushrooms with frozen not fresh shrimp.

The mango salad was OK; mangos where not ready to be eaten yet, but it's hard to ripen mangos to the point where they aren't too mushy.

The roll was good; crispy and fresh but the dipping sauce had a strong after taste that wasn't very pleasing... you'll see why soon

My main dish was #2. Marinated garlic chicken with thai sauce served with peppers and onions. The chicken was good, a little dry, but good. It's plain chicken on a bed of iceberg lettuce. Was not expecting that from the menu's description. Here's where it gets DISGUSTING : the thai sauce was made with minced garlic you can get in jars, the taste was absolutely repulsive. It was in the spring roll dipping sauce too, but the taste was way less imposing than the garlic thai sauce. The ""peppers and onions"" where 2 tiny pieces on top of the chicken.

My spouse had the pad thai with was VERY good.

All and all, the food is OK, the price you pay is not worth what you get on your plate, the ingredients are cheap, I will not be going back to this restaurant.","1 star rating"

The server was incredibly kind and very polite. He recommended the aneng curry w/ fried spring roll as I had expressed that I wanted a dish that was unlike the commonly popular Thai dishes. The meal consisted of red cury pastes, lime leaves, coconut milk, green beans, ground peanuts and chicken breast. 

The entree that was brought was delicious, with portions that were sizeable enough to enjoy but small enough to leave room for the main course. The aneng curry arrived just in time and was nothing short of pleasant. The flavours blended very well together and went well with what was left of the entree. 

My vegan friend enjoyed his Pad Thai and noted that it was some of the best thai food he has tried.

I lived in Thailand for a couple of years way back when so I know Thai food pretty well, from the awesome street food you can get EVERYWHERE to the upscale fusion type places that cost a pretty penny (frankly not worth it except for air conditioning and ambience since the small shop/street food is so damn good).

That makes me picky.

So to my review: if you want Thai food that is anywhere close to authentic do not bother with this place. You will get better for cheaper at just about any Thai Express.

We ordered to go the Tom Yum Keung (shrimp), Kaeng Phet Gai (chicken in red coconut curry), and some Pat See Ewe (flat noodles in brown sauce with beef).

Granted I did not specify how spicy these should be. I forgot. But they did not ask! In that case the default should be Thai medium which is western pretty damn spicy but not intolerable except for the faint of palate. 

The Tom Yum was quite literally the worst I have ever tasted. It tasted like lightly used dishwater infused with an insipid thin tomato soup (like they took a teaspoon of Campbell's tomato soup and added it to a pint of cloudy water. NOTHING like the explosion of exquisite spices and flavors wrapped around a galanga / lemon grass base with a ton of shrimp chilli paste. It is not actually supposed to be eaten like a soup but rather eaten with rice as you would any other curry. This seems odd to the uninitiated because it is so thin, but trust me that is how it is....just like Filipino 'soups'. Even the mild is pretty spicy, or should be. That's why you need the rice.

The red curry was a nice enough base but there was not ONE traditionally thai vege in there. It should be loaded with these mini little eggplants and a few other things like basil leaves, onions etc. Instead it was bulked out with green bell pepper. This is not even a traditional Thai vegetable, but rather an import that is grown in the mountains up in the North of Thailand. I never saw one bell pepper in Bangkok in 2 years of living there except in western restaurants. Worse...I HATE bell peppers. Love chillis of any variety....go figure. The chicken was dried out too. Waste of calories.

Last but not least, the Pat See Ewe: this was passable at best. Or it would have been had they used the right noodles and made it a tad more moist. The noodles were too narrow and for whatever reason they mashed it all up like they were feeding it to a five year old. Also not enough egg in there and barely any beef.

I would have given it one star but I reserve that honour for only the truly terrible in terms of service as well as food. In fact I have only ever given one star and that was to that idiot down in the Old Port who thankfully i can't remember any more.

In short if you are looking for Thai food, don't waste your time or money. If however you are looking for ok tasting NOT-Thai food, maybe you will like it as some other reviewers obviously did.","2 star rating"

But last night was not so great. It was VERY disappointing. We had the ""table d'hôte"" with soup, mango salad, spring roll, rice and our main dish. It cost 45$ for 2 and was not worth the price. 

The soup (Tom Yum) was good; good flavours, but the ingredients inside it where cheap compared to the amazing soup I had years ago. It contained coarsely chopped tomatoes and mushrooms with frozen not fresh shrimp.

The mango salad was OK; mangos where not ready to be eaten yet, but it's hard to ripen mangos to the point where they aren't too mushy.

The roll was good; crispy and fresh but the dipping sauce had a strong after taste that wasn't very pleasing... you'll see why soon

My main dish was #2. Marinated garlic chicken with thai sauce served with peppers and onions. The chicken was good, a little dry, but good. It's plain chicken on a bed of iceberg lettuce. Was not expecting that from the menu's description. Here's where it gets DISGUSTING : the thai sauce was made with minced garlic you can get in jars, the taste was absolutely repulsive. It was in the spring roll dipping sauce too, but the taste was way less imposing than the garlic thai sauce. The ""peppers and onions"" where 2 tiny pieces on top of the chicken.

My spouse had the pad thai with was VERY good.

All and all, the food is OK, the price you pay is not worth what you get on your plate, the ingredients are cheap, I will not be going back to this restaurant.","1 star rating"

The server was incredibly kind and very polite. He recommended the aneng curry w/ fried spring roll as I had expressed that I wanted a dish that was unlike the commonly popular Thai dishes. The meal consisted of red cury pastes, lime leaves, coconut milk, green beans, ground peanuts and chicken breast. 

The entree that was brought was delicious, with portions that were sizeable enough to enjoy but small enough to leave room for the main course. The aneng curry arrived just in time and was nothing short of pleasant. The flavours blended very well together and went well with what was left of the entree. 

My vegan friend enjoyed his Pad Thai and noted that it was some of the best thai food he has tried. 

The restaurant has a nice Asian ambience and I really enjoyed seeing one of the ladies on staff hand rolling the egg rolls at one of the tables behind us, it gave off a very authentic feel.","4 star rating"

I was here yesterday, recommended by a friend for their price, taste and portion size. The waiters seem to be Eastern European and sort of depressed, but they were cool, they gave good advice on what was good on the menu.

Now here's what I thought of the Pad Thai: it was spicy, the chicken was tender, the tofu was soft and sweet, the classic peanuts crumbs were there. The shrimp wasn't too fresh though and there were the hard shrimp tails left on the shrimps. I don't know if that's normal, didn't really bother me. But!... The shrimps honestly could've been fresher. No big deal, I loved it anyway.

With tip, my chicken/shrimp/sweet tofu pad thai came to 12.50$. This might seem like a lot, but it was okay since the portion could've lasted me for lunch and supper.

They had one waiter on the floor and three or four people in the kitchen, which meant that everything came very slowly and sometimes even came cold. Why they would need four people in the kitchen is beyond me because the place was only half full.

I ordered the green curry off the table' d'hote menu and, though it was passable, it was nothing very special; the eggroll that came with was flavorless and the Tom Yum (which seemed like it had been sitting in a heating platter for hours) came with two pieces of raw tomato plopped non-chalantly into its brownish wateriness - as if that would somehow help with its appearance. 

That being said, the mango salad was lovely - but, for god sakes people just go buy yourselves some mango, peanuts and some fish sauce and you can make it at home for a fraction of the price!

From the vibes to the decor, I truly enjoyed my time here.  Walked in without a reservation, the two of us arrived for dinner at 5:45 pm.  As we waited for a table about 5 minutes, the place suddenly filled up, and it was getting fuller so I could tell it's desireable.

It was our first time eating anywhere in Montreal, so it was quite an experience.  I was pleased to know that our waitress was accommodating and spoke English, and oh my goodness she also spoke French as well.  She was superb and made the date night even more out of this world.  She had a way of relating to people...she was genuinely kind. 
  
I ordered the Quebec la glace drink, and it was soooo good and for sangria, just hit the spot.  While we waited, my husband and I found these incredible notes inside our tables that were encouraging to the college students during the pandemic.  I literally cried.  It was a small heartwarming gesture, yet so meaningful to me that this eatery would set aside to time to lift these students.  My heart melted into a puddle.  This is the epitome of awesome in my book.

Oh right back to the food...My hubby had the red beer which he said was nice.  I decided on the hemp burger which came with a salad that was really tasty and delicious.  According to the menu, my hemp burger comprised of tofu, brown lentil & hemp seed patty, BBQ sauce, caramelized onions, queso, tomatoes accompanied by mixed greens & marinated cucumbers with a sweet citrus dressing.  Yum!  

My hub had the house curry with chickpea roti.  It came with seasonal veggies: sweet potatoes, carrots, green beans, turnip, tofu, coconut milk and homemade curry paste.  All of this was served over basmati rice with coriander crema, mango-pineapple chutney along with toasted sesame seeds.   It was so filling that my husband wasn't able to finish it...but no worries, because I did!  :)

Ambience and space: it's a little space but you can reserve your table in advance (highly recommended as it gets REALLY busy).

Parc and Milton? Bruh.

At Parc, I waited with a friend of mine for 45 minutes (including the 10 minutes it took for them to even notice us) and they still messed up the order by giving us rice instead of a crepe (which is an upgrade, so we paid more for something that no one checked to make sure was correct.)

I went to the Milton location a long time ago and haven't been back since the menu got remodeled, but it was weird. The soup of the day was a melon gazpacho, but it was weird and sweet (I shouldn't have ordered it). I was mostly put off by the staff being super rude... But that was a couple summers ago, I only went back when I saw they veganized their menu and was curious.

That burrito. Was. Everything. It took 10 minutes on a busy and beautiful day. 

The new menu is great. Poutine, curry, etc, everything I tried was good. The servings could be a bit bigger but hey, flavour is the most important thing.

From the vibes to the decor, I truly enjoyed my time here.  Walked in without a reservation, the two of us arrived for dinner at 5:45 pm.  As we waited for a table about 5 minutes, the place suddenly filled up, and it was getting fuller so I could tell it's desireable.

It was our first time eating anywhere in Montreal, so it was quite an experience.  I was pleased to know that our waitress was accommodating and spoke English, and oh my goodness she also spoke French as well.  She was superb and made the date night even more out of this world.  She had a way of relating to people...she was genuinely kind. 
  
I ordered the Quebec la glace drink, and it was soooo good and for sangria, just hit the spot.  While we waited, my husband and I found these incredible notes inside our tables that were encouraging to the college students during the pandemic.  I literally cried.  It was a small heartwarming gesture, yet so meaningful to me that this eatery would set aside to time to lift these students.  My heart melted into a puddle.  This is the epitome of awesome in my book.

Oh right back to the food...My hubby had the red beer which he said was nice.  I decided on the hemp burger which came with a salad that was really tasty and delicious.  According to the menu, my hemp burger comprised of tofu, brown lentil & hemp seed patty, BBQ sauce, caramelized onions, queso, tomatoes accompanied by mixed greens & marinated cucumbers with a sweet citrus dressing.  Yum!  

My hub had the house curry with chickpea roti.  It came with seasonal veggies: sweet potatoes, carrots, green beans, turnip, tofu, coconut milk and homemade curry paste.  All of this was served over basmati rice with coriander crema, mango-pineapple chutney along with toasted sesame seeds.   It was so filling that my husband wasn't able to finish it...but no worries, because I did!  :)

I highly recommend this place.  Why you ask?  Because of the good vibes.","5 star rating"

Regardless, we're glad we were able to try the food here. 

For lunch, I ordered the burger au chanvre (hemp burger). The bbq sauce on the burger was too sweet for my taste, and the patty was on the mushier side but the side salad with chickpeas was solid. While we waited for our food to arrive, we noticed that the tables have little drawers where people kept funny notes.

Pros: Homemade Nutella, Bagel BLT

Cons: Potatoes could be better

Overview

We came here for brunch because my friend was vegan! Brunch is only on Saturdays and Sundays! 

I've been to Lola Rosa 2 times before for dinner, but this was the first time for a brunch! They're rolling out a few more brunch menu items- specifically at the Milton location- throughout the summer. I hope to get a chance to try them out after this experience! 

Each brunch item came with a side of potatoes and a small mason jar filled with fruit.

Mains: 

Bagel BLT- this was a super light and satisfying menu item. I added avocado on mine! The lettuce was fresh and crisp, the tomato was nice and not too juicy. There was a crunch from that mock bacon which turned out to be a fried rice paper! It resembled the texture of crispy bacon quite well! 

Pancakes- these pancakes were nice and moist but weren't really fluffy. I think they were made of banana- I didn't ask though! I will tell you though, these were served with an unbelievable delicious homemade Nutella (as well as a side of maple syrup). This Homemade Nutella spread was so good that we drove to the Williams Location to buy a jar of it right after.

Sides:

Fruit Jar- Damn! I hate melons...melons are nauseating to me! However, these were the best melons I ever had! They had mint and basil incorporated into it and they brought out a freshness I never knew possible. There were cantaloupe, honeydew and grape pieces in it. 

Potatoes- these were lightly fried and sprinkled with a bit of paprika to add colour! They reminded me of ones you'd get frozen at the grocery store, then refry it at home! They were crisp but nothing special. I ate it all so I guess that says something ‍

Drinks:

Mimosa- orange juice mixed with cider, how can you go wrong? It was refreshing! Neither sweet nor strong.

Service:

Our waitress was very friendly and allowed us to sit-down at 11:15am when the location opened at 11:30am. She was very honest with the menu and was knowledgeable on how everything was prepared! There was one other waiter, who we felt was pressuring us to leave quickly by asking us 3 times if we were done and if we were ready for the bill- as if people were waiting for our table. There weren't, and it wasn't busy. Maybe he was just pointing out to us that bills had to be printed and paid at the cash...could be a miscommunication so I won't hold that against him! 

Overall I was very happy with my meal! I did not feel sleepy after brunch and felt relatively energized! Would definitely come back!","4 star rating"

I got the burrito which was delicious! As someone who eats meat at every single meal, I have always been skeptical about vegetarian food; however I always leave satisfied when I order the burrito. The portion size is hefty and the presentation of the food is phenomenal. My only critique is that the food could be a bit more flavorful, however that issue is fixed when you put the hot sauce on the burrito. 

While the food I received was excellent, the service was not up to par. My friend and I were seated at the same table as a boisterous party of four, and when we asked our waitress to be seated at a separate table they claimed that the table was ""reserved"", however no one showed up to take the table the whole time we were there. In addition, when I asked for hot sauce for my burrito, I was told that it costs 50 cents, even though the previous four times I've been to this restaurant it's been free of charge.","4 star rating"

It just so happened that the special drink on my birthday was Rose Sangria using organic wine, so naturally, it was my beverage of choice. My entree lasagna was SO GOOD. Honestly, if I could I would love to eat here more often, but I definitely will come back next time I go to Montreal!

Lastly, a cute characteristic of the restaurant is the guests can leave little notes in the drawers of the tables for others to read, and some of them even get hanged on the wall.

Come here even if you are not vegetarian, it is so delicious that you will not regret it!","5 star rating"

My friend and I were in the neighborhood, and we went in for a late lunch. It's a cute rustically decorated restaurant. Their specialty is Mexican and vegetarian food. It's a small place, and it's cozy. I asked for a tequila with orange juice (want with grapefruit but they didn't have); when my drink arrived I found a fruit fly in my drink, I notified the waitress, she apologized and took way my glass, and made me a new glass, and she apologized again and again. The drink was perfect not too much of tequila and not too much of orange juice. I ordered spicy spinach Mac n Cheese, and it came with side salad. The salad was simply ordinary. The Mac n Cheese was spicy but super delicious. The spice was great zing to the dish. After we finished, we were told not to rush, whenever we want we can pay at the cash. As I mentioned, it's a nice cozy spot, after lunch, we continue to chitchat, the service still continued with filling our water jugs.","4 star rating"

The locations is smaller than the other one I've been to but the size contributed to the laid back vibe. We ordered the large nachos to share. It was gigantic and more than enough for 4-6 people. It is topped with tons of ingredients and all the flavours go together very well. I had the hemp burger which was yummy but a little mushy. I'm not sure I'd order that again.

The service was fast and friendly.

The place reminded me of a very rustic old fashioned feel with the chalkboards and the wooden tables and chairs. The service was quick from our one waiter who served the entire restaurant. They are hiring if you're looking. Anyways we ended up ordering the burrito, the quesadilla, and the curry. I specifically got the curry and wow, it was seasoned really well and the amount of spice was enough to get a really nice cook, and the bread was cooked really well. I really enjoyed the sweet mango chutney that came with it. It helped ease the spice and that bite with the curry, the bread and the chutney was out of this world.

It's a fairly small and compact restaurant, very clean, very rustic and cozy, even the washrooms were very clean. The service was great, the servers were very vigilant, they changed our water jug many times for fresh water. They asked several time if we were happy with our meal. I ordered the soup of the day which was good. Then I followed with chipotle chilly which I didn't find spicy. It was black beans based, with a rice layer at the bottom and a few tortilla chips to go along. It was very filling, I really enjoyed it. 

My only disappointment, my friend ordered a drink which had a dead fly. They gave her a new drink, but I expected them to either give a discount or offer it for free. Eventhough they didn't, we still enjoyed the overall experience.","4 star rating"

Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: Casual, trendy, dine in
Wait: 45 mins (Thursday 8PM for 2)

The Experience:
After stalking the menu online for hours, I had high expectations of this place when we finally traveled to Montreal. I was traveling with my bff who is vegetarian, so the trip had to consist of some tasty and interesting vegetarian options. Lola Rosa's did not disappoint.

I dunno why we thought this, but we winged it and just walked there without a reservation. It was quite the wait for dinner and I'm glad we stuck through it for almost an hour. The place is in a neighborhood and is a revamped garage (kinda). Hipster, trendy, or what have you, this place is packed with young to middle-aged trendsetters.

Tonight we indulged in sangria, the heaping Lola's nachos, and quesadillas. The nachos were the highlight. Beautifully constructed mound of fresh ingredients, you'd be a fool not to get this. Very filling to share for two. As for the quesadilla, it wasn't the most memorable, but it helped make the meal along with the nachos. My bff and I left the restaurant stuffed and happy.

Final verdict:
If you're a vegetarian in Montreal, this is one of the best spots. A little different from what you normally get as 'vegetarian,' there's a reason why this place is so crowded and busy.","5 star rating"

I liked the vibe and the food choices were good. I've been a vegetarian for over two years so when I saw they made vegetarian nachos and burritos I thought I'd give it a try.

We got the nachos and the Mac and cheese.

The nachos weren't bad. Overall they had a good taste but being Mexican and coming from California I want this review to be more constructive than anything else. The salsa on the nachos was too much of just a tomato blend. My recommendation would be to add some cilantro and Serrano chili peppers. This will help to add some spice and flavor to the salsa. I was actually quite surprised at the chips beans etc though. Not bad. You could even try to sprinkle some lime in there as well over the top. Not too generous.

Mac n cheese. I love Mac n cheese. It was very good. Unfortunately the jalapeños that were in it had no flavor. I would recommend using pickled jalapeños as those tend to keep flavor very well. I'm not sure if you have these in canada but the favorite brand over here in the Los Angeles area is Embasa Jalapeños. 

Service was great and very friendly. I wouldn't mind stopping by again if I am visiting.","3 star rating"

I tried both Lola locations and much prefer the location on Avenue du Parc because I prefer the ambiance. The space is larger and it's not quite as loud. The menu differs from location to location (more vegan options at Lola Rosa Parc). That said, both restaurants employ lovely staff who are accommodating and attentive. They are doing something right!

If you come on in the evening, do make reservations at this location. I arrived at 9pm and the entire place was packed, save for one table, the one we had reserved. Not only was it packed, but as I mentioned before, extremely loud, to the point where we pretty much were shouting at each other (and, unfortunately, the waitress. I hate being rude). I much preferred the place an hour later when the crowd had left. 

On to the menu... it's well-edited. Nothing too creative or out of this world about it, which isn't always a bad thing. I ordered the soup of the day, which was a curried chickpea soup. I didn't love it, didn't hate it. I'm not a fan of completely pureed soups in general and this also needed salt. Next up, the tacos. What is really outstanding about them is the seitan, which is perfectly chewy without being rubbery and bursting with flavor. Seitan is often so bland and boring. This is the great kind! I just wish there was more of it in the tacos. 

Lola Rosa Parc has out-of-this-world phenomenal chickpea fries. I mean... the kind of fries that you're compelled to burn your mouth on. This location does not have them. I love those fries so much that I'm mentioning them in a review for Lola Rosa Milton, so there ya go!

But what that other location doesn't have that this one does have is the Twix bar vegan dessert... a dessert in a league (or paragraph) of its own! Normally I'm too full from dinner to order dessert, but to be honest, I wasn't really in love with anything I ordered so room, I had aplenty and that's kind of serendipitous because this dessert is that insanely good.","4 star rating"

The place was packed when I walked in with all but 2 tables filled.  Despite this I was greeted and seated immediately.  Nice.

The ambiance is informal, relaxed, but energetic with a little whimsy on the side.  Individual tables for two get pulled together for larger groups.

The menu is short but I found several attractive options.  If I had stayed in the area I would have gone back to sample other options.

The ice cream with almonds was outstanding and brilliant in its simplicity.

In Montreal for work and needed to grab a bite to eat, so I slap ""vegan"" into the ol' Yelp search and just picked the closest place. When they asked me if I was ready to order I just gave two easy instructions. Bring me the darkest beer you have on tap and your favorite dish on the menu. I wound up with an amber-ish Christmas beer and the tunisian stew. First I was super surprised that both hit the table within like 5 minutes. The stew was amazing, great sweet savory pairing brought home by raisins and cinnamon balanced out with feta and tumeric. It was home-y it was warming, the perfect dish for a chilly night with a dusting of snow. The beer really went nicely with the dish with a little bit of spice of it's own. 

A great dish like that gave me enough confidence to try their dessert and I went with the Twix Tarte. It was awesome, rich and fudge-y filling with an awesome chocolate sauce. It definitely was reminiscent of Twix but in a much more grown up, much more indulgent sort of way. The service was fast and friendly. I really lucked out stumbling into a gem here.

We went with a rather large group (8 hungry guys between 21-25), and somehow managed to get a table without a reservation. In a city full of of smoked meat sandwiches and bbq pulled pork poutine, this is a haven for vegetarians, This restaurant fit the bill and left everyone happy, and most importantly, full on a quality vegetarian meal. 

Food: impeccable. Most people ordered a burrito (debatable contest for best burrito they've ever had), quesadillas (which made a few appearances on Instagram), or the curry (I forgot it was spicy, but still just as delicious).

Desserts: what really put the meal over the top was the sangria. Rather inexpensive (I'm used to NYC prices) and delicious. We got a sangria made with cinnamon and whiskey, which I've never seen before but all I want to do is steal the recipe and make it at home. 

Cons of the restaurant: the wait. Like I mentioned, we didn't have much of a wait, but I walked by the restaurant during peak hours and saw a line out the door more than once. But, you can make a reservation AND THEY DELIVER!!

Next time I'm in Montreal, I'm definitely going back, and if the owner is reading this, please message me your whiskey and cinnamon sangria recipe so I can spread the goodness with some deprived and overcharged New Yorkers.","5 star rating"

Happily, everyone loved the delicious comfort food. Lola Rosa is quite a cozy restaurant, so we were a bit squeezed into our table, but once the food came out, everyone was happy.

I am the furthest thing from a vegetarian but this place still manages to leave me very satisfied. 

Two weeks ago I ordered the burrito with avocado on top, which was excellent. But I am a sucker for Mac & Cheese so when I saw it on the recently added portion of their menu, I had to indulge. The Mac & Cheese had spinach and jalapeno in it--giving it the perfect amount of kick. We also had the infamous nachos to share as an app--the half portion was plenty for three!

Pro tip: This place is small and almost always packed--go a bit earlier or later than peak meal hours and avoid going here with a big group. Don't forget to check the drawers of the tables--they're full of notes from previous diners!","4 star rating"

Lola Rosa is an exception. The food is delicious and interesting, even for committed carnivores, and the small and quaint interior is charming. The servers are always cheerful and friendly - all in all a great informal dining experience. We returned tonight on a whim, after calling to see whether there was a line (a Wednesday at 8 pm). There was not so we went straight there. The burrito, the nachos and the black bean burger were excellent. They have a limited but interesting beer selection and good sangria. Highly recommend!","5 star rating"

A vegetarian restaurant sensitive to all needs, this restaurant's menu is bursting with flavor waiting for you to discover. I eat vegan most of the time, and find many restaurants really lose heart when it comes to bold spice in vegan food. This place has no such reservations!
Gluten free? Zero worries, my friend. You are welcome here.
In spite of the warm weather, I had a Tunisian Tagine that pretty much blew my mind. With it I had a Glutenberg beer (of course). What will I have next? I'm thinking those nachos I saw looked pretty awesome.

I came to Lola Rosa for a lunch date with my boyfriend, as it was recommended to him by a friend. The restaurant is quite cute, and in a nice area near McGill. We couldn't decide what to get, as everything looked and sounded amazing, and finally settled on a half portion of nachos and a mac & cheese. The nachos were AMAZING. covered in mozzarella, black beans, tomatoes, green onions, and some avocado and sour cream (I would have preferred more avo and sour cream, but that's a personal preference maybe). The mac & cheese was good, but not the best. We chose it because it was kind of cold outside, and we wanted some comfort food, and what better comfort food is there than mac and cheese? It just didn't have the richness or cheesiness that we were looking for, although the more I ate of it, the more I liked it, however I don't think I'd order it again. 

A word to the wise: portions here are HUGE. We were really hungry going in, and left completely stuffed (and this is for two people who love to eat). Either come very hungry, or share with a friend. We saw someone order nachos, which were what we thought was the full portion, so were proud of ourselves for choosing the half portion. Turns out what we thought was the full was the half, and the full portion is MASSIVE. 

I'd definitely come back here next time I'm in Montreal to try more things, and get the nachos again. The service was friendly, and prices are fair. We paid about 25 dollars for our meal.","4 star rating"

I've given this place a few tries! The hemp burger was recommended to me, but i found it rather stodgy and dry, although it came with a nice side-salad. The black bean sauce on the Poutine made an already heavy dish (!) extra heavy, although it had sweet potato fries which was nice. I got the nachos to take away, and there was hardly any toppings/cheese on them, it was almost just a plate of dry tortilla chips!!  The best thing I've had there is the curry which is nice and chunky but still lacked flavour.

My partner being vegetarian, we thought we'd check out Lola Rosa which seemed to offer a non run of the mill menu. 

Food: we ordered a tomato tart and a lasagna. The lasagna was as good as a vegetarian lasagna can get. The tomato tart was in a well made pastry, but the filling could have been made slightly more interesting. It had finely chopped tomato and onions, so gave one the feeling of the main ingredient missing. Both dishes came with a lettuce salad with some shredded beet and carrot.  Filling and tasty enough. The most unique of the order and the star was the soup du jour - kale, white wine and coconut milk. Small portion but very tasty. Food gets 3.5 (4 for the soup though!)

Ambience: the place is small, and feels warm and cozy, filling the room with a warm yellow light. There's a big window that opens out to the road and is kept open in the summer time - brings in light and adds character. Ambience gets a 3.5.

Service: There were 2 women serving that evening. Ours was a very efficient, friendly and pleasant lady (we asked when we got seated if we could have another table instead, she was very nice about it) service gets a 4.

Overall: I definitely recommended this restaurant - good food, warm ambience, great service. Note: we came here on a Saturday evening and we waited about 20 minutes for a table of 2 - there was a decent sized line the whole time we were there, testament to a deserved popularity.","4 star rating"

I had one of those rare ""omigod is this meat"" moments because it looked like a ""real"" burger patty and tasted far too good to be made of humble ingredients like hemp, lentils and tofu. Next to the burger sat a generous side salad with chickpeas. Call me a happy camper! 

Before the aforementioned amazing burger arrived, I forgot that I had to wait 40 mins to get a table for dinner on a Saturday night (word to the wise: it is busy!!) by whiling away the time reading the curious, cute and downright deep notes tucked away in the drawers at each table. I was enamoured enough to write my own. (Sorry I had to hijack the back of somebody else's!)

It's always SUPER busy every time I've been here. One time we decided to pass up here cause it was too busy lined up outside haha. 

Food: this 2nd time was solid food again, and was enjoyable. My chai tea latte was great, the daily soup was tasty, and the half order of nachos I shared was great but it feel like it wasn't as good as the last time I was here. But still good nonetheless! 

Cool: I found in my table (there all old school desks it seems) and the drawer in my table had all these handwritten notes in it and so did my persons across from me. The notes had random stories, peoples thoughts experiences, and even random love notes etc haha it was great and made me smile ! 

Hopefully it I come here again in the future if I'm in Montreal again. I can update this to 5 stars! 

If your in the area and are young I recommend checking this place out. For the older crowd, not sure if it's so great for you. Noisy and full of young people. But hey good food!","4 star rating"

My husband had a sangria which he enjoyed it was garnished with a cinnamon stick, oranges and fresh cranberries. We both ordered the small nachos with avocado, one without sour cream and our orders came just as requested. While we were waiting we discovered small drawers in our table containing handwritten notes from past customers so we made sure to leave a note also. Our food was beyond delicious.

Last time I came here, I order the salad and asked for a vegan version, which meant removing the cheese. However, when the salad came there very visible pieces of cheese on my salad. I asked and they took it back and removed the cheese. In my friend's order, they forgot the avocados.

We went with a big group and tried six dishes and weren't overly impressed- most of it lacked salt and flavor. The Mac and cheese was I think the best but it was more of a pesto, Alfredo pasta.

I ordered the burrito. The burrito and salad were both excellent - some of the best food I've had since arriving in Montreal. The rice was good, but not as flavorful as the other things on my plate. The service was okay (made me wait outside for my takeout which was sort of strange - the restaurant wasn't full) and the price came to about $15 which I don't think was totally reasonable for my meal.

To start, the service was incredible!  All of the servers were so nice and spoke great French and English to serve most customers.  The restaurant itself had a lovely atmosphere and was great shelter from the freezing cold!  The menu is chock-full of vegan and vegetarian options with a load of choices for any palate.  

For appetizers we got the vegan nachos and vegan samosas, which were both incredible.  The samosas were the favorite, but the nachos were definitely a hit as well.  For a meal, I got the curry which was delicious.  It had the perfect amount of spice to it without being too hot.  My dad got the hemp burger, which had cheese on it so I couldn't try it, but he thought it was fantastic as well.  Other meals that were ordered included the mac and cheese and the burrito, which were also hits among the family!  We also got a slice of their new Twix cake for dessert which was also fantastic.

Just look at this gorgeous table of food... and then mail me your favorite dish and a thank you note when you go (I am in the states... wishing I was now Canadian).","5 star rating"

The hipster vibe of the renovated garage that its located in is very cool, and I thought the handwritten notes hidden in the draws of the tables you are sitting at (look for them, many people don't know about these!) are really fun touches.  

The food is amazing, and I'd suggest the nachos, especially to share with a table as it is HUGE, or the burrito, which come very fresh and delectable. One of the only problems is some of the food takes about 20 minutes of preparation upon ordering (like the mac and cheese I believe), so know that you may have to wait for all the goodness. Also, you can't leave without at least two pitchers of their sangria, both the red and white are amazing!

Warning: the building and seating is quite small, and the place, of course, is incredibly popular even on off-hours (I even had tow wait a while for a Monday). I'd suggest calling for a reservation before you go, because you may have to wait outside for a long time, even though it is really worth the wait! Once I waited for about an hour and a half outside in the frosty Montreal winter, which is a testament to both how long the lines are, but also how worth the wait is!","5 star rating"

A well curated mix of dishes including Mexican flavours, salads, and comfort food. The staff was welcoming and knowledgable - nothing special but they answered any questions we had. They seemed to be going for a nonchalant atmosphere though, so it fit well. My party of three was able to relax and enjoy our food in a timely manner, which is all we could ask for.

I had a baked mac and cheese with a side of house salad. The Mac and cheese was great. They threw some spinach and sour cream in and used havarti cheese, which was creamy and rich. The potion size was not especially big, but it was a nice lunch size. The house salad added a bit of summer to the gloomy November afternoon, with sweet dressing and an orange garnish. My friends both got bean burritos with avacodo and loved them. My friend Jesse said it was in the top five burritos he'd ever had.

The table we sat at had little drawers full of notes from past customers. It was great to peek into some other people's lives after the meal :) Overall, I'd give Lola Rosa five black beans out of five. This was also the day before our friend Chris's birthday.

The service was great. Beer list was just okay. I probably wouldn't come back to this location and would go to their Parc location next time to avoid a bunch of students.

I'm a huge fan of ultra-tasty vegetarian food, and this ain't it. Bland, bland, bland.

The ambiance is warm and inviting. I've always had competent, polite service. Noise level is reasonable. It's right in the heart of the McGill Ghetto, so it's often crowded with student groups--not a good place to try to seat any party larger than 4.

The problem is the food. I've had something different each time I've gone, and I've sampled bites from my companions' plates, and all of the food is unimpressive. Everything has always been cooked properly and served promptly, but that just makes it all the more apparent that this food has no flavor. It's precisely dishes like these that give vegetarian fare a bad name. It's filling enough, but it's just no fun to eat. Go to Aux Vivres instead, where they understand how to draw bold flavor out of vegetables.","2 star rating"

I had heard nothing but good things about this place but there was nothing I could do to convince them otherwise. I finally got the chance to go and boy are they missing out! We started with a demi portion of nachos - the best nacho dish in Montreal. This is not an exaggeration. This demi portion puts all other full portion sizes to shame as it is a heaping pile of crispy nachos covered with beets, avocado, chilli, cheese, black beans, and other goods. For two people this is a meal on its own, but I ordered the seitan and black bean burger and really did enjoy it. I was not too crazy about the side of chick peas it came with but I really liked the salad dressing (whatever it was). My girlfriend ordered the seitan tacos dressed with coriander and spicy mayo. The one bite she let me have was tasty, though I found the seitan to be overpowering.

I've also ordered in vegetarian curry (with sweet potato, chickpeas, and tempeh) & poutine (sweet potato & potato mixed) from the other Lola Rosa location that does delivery. 

The menu selection here is super creative and unlike any other place I've been. It's a vegetarian place and have dishes ranging from burrito to curry. I live in San Francisco, where there are many ethnic and creative food options, but I still crave food from Lola Rosa Cafe. Many nice restaurants in the bay area serve foods that are too complex in flavor. The place isn't very big, but as others have said tables have enough distance between tables for privacy. Both the food and the restaurant is very cozy and intimate, and place felt woody (if I'm remembering correctly). I didn't see it but my friend was wowed by their serving of coffee (not sure which kind) somebody else was having because of it's foamy top.

I wish there were more restaurants like Lola Rosa; unpretentious, serving homely, healthy food that's creative but cohesive and simple in overall taste/flavor.

It's right next to McGill University and is very comfortable. They have quaint tables with little drawers in them filled with notes from people who have visited them over the years. It is fun to read the notes. The entire place has a warm and inviting ambiance. 

The owner's sister served us and was incredibly friendly and thoughtful. She gave us great recommendations, shared recipes and was very cheerful and positive. We were there for a good two hours and had a great time. 

We were very hungry and ordered a lot of food. We were three people and ordered the samosas, two chilis and one burrito. We also ordered the craft beer. They were gigantic portion sizes, we could have ordered just two items and been extremely satisfied. We had a huge to-go box filled with delicious food when we left. 

Craft Beer (L'alchemiste): A very balanced and fruity amber beer, we really enjoyed it. It almost had a mango tinge to it, which was surprising. 

Samosa: Absolutely delicious.It wasn't a traditional samosa by any means but a modern version filled with vegetables. The accompanying salad was the highlight of the evening. It had greens, carrots and beets. The dressing was tart, sweet and unbelievably tasty. I am not a big salad fan but I could eat that salad and dressing all day. So so good. 

Chili: The chili was flavorful, satisfying and delightful. We tried our best to finish them but we couldn't and packed almost 3/4th of the portion. 

Burrito: Another fantastic entree. The burrito was filled with lovely, unexpected flavors. It paired very well with the beer too. 

We were enveloped in an aura of contentment at the end of this meal. If we are in Montreal again, we will make sure to make a pilgrimage to this place and try the other things on their menu.","5 star rating"

Their desserts are always worth trying.  I've had the pumpkin pie, the apple crisp, the banana chocolate pie and I've enjoyed them all.  In fact it's always hard to narrow down the selection to just one.

Everyone left the table happy, satisfied, and pleasantly surprised at how awesome vegetarian/vegan food is. (I told them so)

The style is very boho, with quaint little details that make it even more unique of a space. One being, if your table has little drawers...open them. One of my friends just had to snoop around and she was delightfully surprised to find little love notes. Over a pitcher of their red sangria, it was a great topic of conversation, and a perfect start to our Montreal adventure.","5 star rating"

Its near the university, so expect a college crowd.  As others have noted, its small and easy to miss.  But when you go in, it feels very homey.  A little crowded but it somehow ends up feeling intimate.

The food is vegetarian, which is somewhat difficult to find in Montreal, and tasty.  I had the burrito and nachos and didn't notice the lack of meat in either.  They were out of lasagna for the day (but it sounded incredible), and I overheard a couple people raving about the quesadillas.  A solid varied menu with many options.  One of the other reviewers said it was bland.  I was with someone who regularly dumps hot sauce on everything, and we both agreed it was great.  Coming from San Francisco, a city with plenty of vegetarian options; that's saying something.

From other revues, I suspect it was the owner who waited on us.  She was great, attentive, and very helpful. 

And make sure you check the drawers in the tables for the notes.

Finally - the full order of nachos is enough for two.  Its a serious pile o' food.","5 star rating"

The nachos are pretty popular. I might hazard a guess that around 80% of the tables at the nachos--either full portion (MOUNTAIN STATUS) or the half portion: manageable.
My friend and I shared the half portion nachos (which come with bell peppers, cheese, black beans, avocado, sour cream, tomatos, ...!) and then I had the half rosa salad and she had the lasagna.
(as with all nachos: eat quickly or else they get soggy.)
A DEFINITE RECOMMEND.

The salad was delightful: it's got chickpeas which automatically mean pluses in my book. the lasagna had spinach and looked gloriously cheesy. It comes with a side caesar salad as well.
from what I've heard, the desserts are worth a try too...but after all that food, we were right stuffed! maybe next time...we'll be back. watch out!

The menu has some soups and salads, veggie burgers and some other items. Most of the food here seems to be served with rice and a salad of some kind. I ordered some nachos and I felt like I was eating a much healthier version of them. I ordered a 1/2 portion, which was served on a pizza cutting board. The nachos were topped with cheese, avocado, black beans, tomatoes, green peppers,  green beans, and sour cream. Messy to eat, but so yummy. The nachos didn't come with the side orders I mentioned before, but the meal was quite filling.

This place is around McGill University and seems to be really popular with the students.  It was very busy when I arrived with my date and we had to wait around a 1/2 hour for a table. The place is small, so reservations might be a good idea!

Also, check what's inside the drawers on the tables, you'll be amused.

Wooden tables and comfortable seating. Atmosphere is nice, and they have a small bar.

For lunch, I got the soup, which was very good. Salad was OK, but not impressive. The salad portion was sizable, however. 

The service is friendly for the most part, but was slow. A soup and salad should not really take 20 minutes or so. Much of this delay, I think, was because the person whom I placed the order with was eating his lunch and did not bother to move quickly to place or make the order. 

Overall, my experience was really worth 3.5 stars, but I am bumping it up because I may have misinterpreted the slowness. I would go back and try something other than salad.","4 star rating"

Since we were only two people and had a reservation, we were seated right away. The ambience of this place is really cool, they have drawers at every table that are filled with notes from past customers.

Within 15 excruciating minutes we were about ready to call it quits but then in walked a patron with a reservation and encouraged us to wait as it would be well worth it. We stayed and boy am I glad we did. My 4 kids can be about the finickiest bunch as they come. They all enjoyed their food.

When I go there to dine in, I am always satisfied and am especially a fan of the Salad Rosa. Sometimes, when I'm at work and didn't have time to bring lunch, I will get a salad to go. This is the only situation where I have kindof a grip with this place- you never know how much salad you're actually going to get! I usually order the full portion to go and sometimes it is filled with lettuce and other times (like today) it was more like a small scattering of mesclun at the bottom. I really do like Lola Rosa (esp nachos-yum!) but this inconsistency for a salad that is almost $14 after tax is pretty annoying. If I ordered a large salad, I want a large salad!","4 star rating"

It came highly recommended and we had loved the restaurants that we had chosen so far. After a long walk, we finally came to this place and loved the decor. But we were surprised to read the menu which had nothing ""Mexican"" about it. It is a vegan place that has twisted Indian and Mexican dishes. The place did not have AC on that day but had their window shutters open. We still Accepted it since we did not care about AC that much until little bugs started flying all around us. After taking our order, the arrogant waitress came to us after about 15 minutes and informed us that they were out of Tacos. We did not care that much yet and some of us changed our order to burrito. We got 2 nacho plates for 2 tables but were surprised that the bugs were falling on those nachos and no one really had a problem with it. We then saw the waitress closing the shutter doors after which it became too hot in that room and still there were many bugs trapped in that so called restaurant which was almost as big as a ""one car garage"". While we were looking at this with disgust, the waitress came and announced that they ran out of chili and again asked us to change the order. We had so far been very impressed with Montreal hospitality and it was sad to end our good time with this (where bugs were being served with food that we were required to change our order three times). We had enough in the name of this vegan crap in addition to having this crap in the humidity of this dungeon!!!! 

I then asked the waitress to bill me for what we all had been served so far and cancel our remaining order because it was hard to have a nice dining experience in a humid place with bugs flying all around and kids getting scared of then. But instead of being apologetic for our horrible experience, she told me, "" you will have to pay for it"". Again it was not about money but the experience of eating bugs that was bothering me. She then called her team and they all argued with me and told me repeatedly that they have already closed the shutters and We should be ok. She also told me that she has cancelled my order but I reminded her that my order was not cancelled but instead they did not have what many of us had ordered and we were being forced to eat what we did not want. I was also amazed to see that some servers were actually eating in the kitchen while they were also cooking and serving food in the dishes. In the end, I paid for everything and walked out because there was no point in trying to get them to see the meaning in all this . They still did not get what I was trying to convey. I am sure that there are many locals who feel that being vegan is being stylish but supporting this business where people are arrogant and unhygienic and where they treat tourists like ""one time customers"" is not cool.","1 star rating"

I am not exactly a go forward for vegetarian food, but hands down for this place. Very tasty and hearty food. We started with the soup of the day which was a blend of cauliflower, carrots and some extra veggies, all blended together with the right amount of heat. Following that, my wife had the Chilli and I had the three cheese lasagna (not considered vegetarian for some due to the cheese) and both were exceptional. Service was very good, staff was friendly and prompt. All in all, it definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.","4 star rating"

We all know though that quality weighs more heavily in the ranking. Luckily for me that wasn't a concern here either. I was excited to try out this popular establishment when I read about it recently on a ""places to eat in Montreal"" blog. I love vegetarian food; I love Mexican and I love good value for my money. This place hit on all fronts. I arrived at 7 and had to wait 30 minutes for a table as it was jam packed with what appeared to be all university students. When I was finally seated I received prompt friendly service. I ordered a glass of red wine ($6 per glass! Bonus!), chips and salsa to start and the quesadilla with sweet potato. The chips were warm and substantially thick and served with hot (as in steam rising from the bowl) salsa. That was kind of odd and it reminded me of chili without beans but after a few tries they grew on me. I really liked my quesadilla and nice little salad on the side. I didn't bother eating the accompanying rice as the carb heavy main course was already very filling. Overall I thought it was great value for the money and I would recommend it as a place to go if you are in that neighborhood.","4 star rating"

I didn't really know what to expect because I love meat, chicken, pork and fish and I would never ever consider becoming vegetarian. 

This place is in the heart of the McGill ghetto. So, you must expect to have a lot of students around. The restaurant itself is very small and it can get very loud. Thus I would not recommend this restaurant for a first/second/third date, because you pretty much have to yell at each other to have a conversation. 

From the lunch menu, I ordered the burrito and my friend chose the half plate of nachos. I'll admit it: I expected vegetarian food to be dry. Yet, the burrito (filled with black beans) was surprisingly juicy and full of flavours. There also was a side of rice and a small salad, but I barely touched both because I just loved the burrito and it was quite big. 

My friend's half plate of nachos was HUGE. She's a varsity athlete and she didn't even finish it. She said she and her mother once ordered the full plate of nachos and there were leftovers.  

I heard their desserts are very good (I saw someone eating their brownie and it looked delicious). However, I was too full after my meal to try it. 

Price: $12.50 before taxes, which is very reasonable.  

One last comment, the service was a little slow. However, the place was full and there was a birthday lunch at the same time. 

Conclusion: I will probably go back to try the plate of nachos and their brownie.","4 star rating"

But I recently went to the place again with my friends and it was not upto my expectations. The proportion size has decreased and the presentation is not as enticing as it was earlier.

After being away for several years I went back this weekend and ordered the nachos and hemp burger. The hemp burger was very different from what I had remembered - no longer on a bagel but served on two very thin slices of white toast. Needless to say I wasn't impressed, but the person I was with really liked it so I'm torn on this! The nachos were exactly the same, piled high with beans and veggies (maybe not as much avocado as before) and still very tasty. The server told us that the chef had changed 6 months ago and kept the nachos the same but changed some other items! So that makes sense for the hemp burger. Ohh just wish they had kept it the same.

My sister had always wanted to try from Lola Rosa's selection of vegetarian food and while I was visiting town, we decided to give it a go one evening. With a pint of beer and a quesadilla before me in what seemed like no time, I quickly forgot about the bone-chilling cold wind outside. We shared a plate of the picante quesadilla, with spicy peppers and sweet potato (who woulda thought?!) and it tasted AMAZING! It wasn't too spicy, just perfect, and the dish also came with some tasty rice and a side of salad. The space is nice and small, very cozy, with comfy pillows to sit on at the tables near the window.

You have to know what to order to get a bang for your buck here.I made the mistake of ordering the lentil curry. Tasty, but nothing I couldn't have put together in 20 minutes at home. The portion was also quite small. 
The one thing I can whole-heartily recommend on the menu is the TEMPEH BURGER! It was cooked and seasoned to perfection and was a sizable portion.","3 star rating"

I got there a bit before noon, so I managed to avoid waiting outside and got a good seat.

I ordered the quiche of the day, but without the rice that comes with it. Even then the portion was adequate and filling, but the food itself was pretty average. The quiche crust was made of puff pastry that was somewhat dry and burnt, while the filling was tasteless and I could barely find the vegetables in it. The accompanying salad was not extraordinary either, just a mountain of shredded lettuce leaves and some dressing. I don't think it was worth the $15 I spent on food that day.

I was not impressed with the service, since the person who took our orders seemed to be in a hurry and rushed us through, despite the fact that the restaurant was not even full by then. Ironically, the food then took some 25 minutes to arrive.

I'm not sure if I'll check out their new location and try some other item on their menu, because I've been to better vegetarian restaurants in Montreal where the food was delicious and well-worth the price.

I'm really giving a 3 out of 5 because I think Lola Rosa Milton is a bit overrated and overpriced.","3 star rating"

I was not disappointed and this will be my go-to when I come back to visit again! Here they serve stand-out dishes from Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia!

Food: I got to try the beef rendang and the beef krapow - both are must-haves. If you are concerned about eating too much beef, this is the one time where it is okay! There are vegetables and fragrant rice to balance it out.

The depth of flavour and boldness of their special spice blend transports you to another part of the world. I personally did not find the dishes spicy-hot and was happy with that spice level. I only tasted two other beef rendangs in my life but this is so far my #1.

Service/atmosphere: There is limited seating so take-out is encouraged. I luckily got to dine-in and enjoyed seeing all the action in the open kitchen. I remember watching the oil splatter out of the wok when the fried runny egg was cooking - that takes risk.

First, what the heck is a Krapow?   To us anglophones, it sounds like something you don't want to associate with food. Turns out 'krapow' is a variety of Thai basil. 

Krapow is a small storefront meant for takeout food. There are two small tables in the restaurant, a counter and the kitchen. 

The menu is limited to a handful of Thai, Malaysian and Indonesian dishes. One guy -- the owner? -- appears to be the whole operation. 

The food is tasty, super fresh, and mildly spicy. (This is Canada, after all.)

There's soup (excellent!), one beef dish (didn't try it), one chicken dish (tasty), and a seasonal vegetarian dish made out of winter melon (excellent). That's it.  

The only thing I should have asked was a bit of extra sriracha. 

The portions are large.  When I placed the order the guy told me I needed two soups and two entrees for two people.  Way too much food. Ate some of the leftovers for breakfast this morning, tossed out the rest.  

So here's the bottom line: if you're looking for excellent Asian takeout on le Plateau, give Krapow a try.","4 star rating"

We started with spring rolls and dumplings which admittedly aren't the most Thai dishes around but I have a major weakness for dumplings in peanut sauce.  Both were pretty solid.  The peanut sauce clearly had a spice in it to give it extra flavour.  I can't put my finger on what it was but I did enjoy it.  That was followed by a shrimp pad thai for me.  The dish was well seasoned and they got the spicy levels just right.  It was spicy enough to have a little zing to it but not so much that I was breathing fire.

Prices are very reasonable.  Dinner for two came out to about $50 after tax which isn't bad at all considering we ordered appetizers, mains and beer.  They also do takeout so if you live nearby you can come here to pick up some food for lunch or dinner.

It was bar-none the best Thai food in Montreal in large part to the Thai auntie and uncle who managed the kitchen.
When they left the Faubourg St-Catherine and set up shop as a restaurant in the Gay Village, I followed them there as well and while a small bit of the magic they had established at the Faubourg was lost, the food was still the same, if you wanted extra basil or garlic or spiciness levels, you could still get it.
There was always a place to get a glass of water or more chilli sauce, chopsticks or lime wedges for your dish if you wanted it.
Of course the pandemic has changed everything and Cuisine Bangkok is now Mama Bangkok and it is back on the second floor of the Faubourg towards the back side as a strictly take-out counter.I had their signature dish which has always been my favourite, the shrimp pad Thai medium spicy.  It was fine and tasted the same but now prices have jumped substantially, there's no extra anymore, rice is charged extra when before it came as part of the meal. The free glasses of water and chilli sauce or chopsticks no longer exist, I saw the same Thai auntie and uncle in the back and both have aged a lot, and the service is curt, terse and borderline aggressive. The warmth and magic of the old Cuisine Bangkok is gone completely and is part of a pattern of parts of Montreal from the 1980s and 90s disappearing very quickly under all this expansion, construction and gentrification of Shaughnessy Village. 
All I got to say is that there were periods in my life when I was living overseas and other countries and whenever I came back to Montreal and wanted a taste of ""home"", Cuisine Bangkok was always one of my required pit-stops.

I'm sure most of us have had great Thai food at Faubourg aka greenhouse food court. Their cashier, the lady behind the counter taking order has never been a fan of customer service.

Well I thought, after the pandemic, thing would have changed. It did, but to the worse.

I was so happy to know Mama Bangkok have moved back to faubourg so I decided to show some support.
I got there, the same lady is there, she's probably part of the owner, Mama Bangkok's daughter perhaps. Her attitude went from bad to worse. Giving out pissed off attitude to customer, no thank you, no gratitude whatsoever. I mean if you don't like being there, just close it down for good or have someone else do it.

Now the food, it's just not the same. In the past we could taste passion from the dishes. I ordered the same old that I used to, basil shrimp with little spicy. To begin, it was not even spicy, not a single bit. The shrimp seems to be boiled aside then the vegetables. Completely tasteless.

During and after pandemic, local businesses struggle to survive, some of them adjusted their price and I find it reasonable if the quality remains. This time around, not so much. The basil shrimp is now at $13.99, rice is not included.

In all and all, it's just not worth it anymore to go there. Bad attitude on customers when we are there to support. Food quality went down, price went up. I don't see a point going back anymore for me. 

Listen, this is only my opinion. Maybe the lady behind the counter was having a bad day. You could be getting another experience, well if you go, I really wish your experience is better than mine. 

Please continue to support local businesses. We are coming out of a long long pandemic, we need to support small businesses.

This is located on the lobby floor of the Renaissance Marriott Downtown. 

They have a great bar area and some casual seating as well. We asked for some dumplings and with the suggestion of our server ended up with Hai Gow and Siu Mai. We also took the suggestion to get some Peking Duck Bao buns. 

Everything was fresh and delicious. My only suggestion is that the Hai Gow needed a sauce, even just some soy sauce if nothing else. The issue is that the texture of the dumpling can end up a little gummy. Perhaps this is just a preference thing. But again, we really enjoyed everything!

Our server, whom I think had a British accent was just amazing. She was so polite and helpful. Wish I had caught her name to give proper credit.

Le menu à plusieurs type de nourriture qui devrait plaire à tout le monde. Sushi , ramen, salade, repas végé, boeuf, porc, poulet, tofu (...) On manque vraiment pas de choix.

J'ai essayé le poulet général tao. Je dois dire que c'est un des meilleur que j'ai mangé. Le poulet était bien tendre, légèrement pané, la sauce était suffisamment présente et délicieuse pour bien accompagner le poulet. En accompagnement, du bok Choy frit avec du riz blanc. Je ne suis pas un fan du bok Choy mais ce n'était pas mauvais. Je trouvais que ça goutais rien mais mon amie m'a dit que c'était très goûteux. Le bok Choy en général goûte rien pour moi alors je ne blâme pas la recette. J'aurais préféré quelques légume comme brocoli, carotte, etc.

Ma compagne à prit les nouilles Shangai. Elle a vraiment aimé son repas, tout était goûteux et frais.

Elle a aussi essayé la soupe tonkatsu. Le tout était bien préparé dans un bouillon bien goûteux.

Comme il s'agit d'un restaurant d'hôtel, l'endroit est alors un peu plus huppé qu'un restaurant plus traditionnel et le prix le reflète. La moyenne des repas sont à partir de 22$ en montant. Il m'en a coûté 30$ après taxes pour mon poulet général tao seul, avant pourboire.

Mais le prix amène une touche de qualité. Les ingrédients sont frais et bon.

Dans l'ensemble, je vais y retourner. J'y retournerais probablement plus souvent si c'était plus abordable, mais ce n'est pas non plus un endroit hyper cher, juste légèrement plus que les restaurant standards.","5 star rating"

This is located on the lobby floor of the Renaissance Marriott Downtown. 

They have a great bar area and some casual seating as well. We asked for some dumplings and with the suggestion of our server ended up with Hai Gow and Siu Mai. We also took the suggestion to get some Peking Duck Bao buns. 

Everything was fresh and delicious. My only suggestion is that the Hai Gow needed a sauce, even just some soy sauce if nothing else. The issue is that the texture of the dumpling can end up a little gummy. Perhaps this is just a preference thing. But again, we really enjoyed everything!

Our server, whom I think had a British accent was just amazing. She was so polite and helpful. Wish I had caught her name to give proper credit.

Le menu à plusieurs type de nourriture qui devrait plaire à tout le monde. Sushi , ramen, salade, repas végé, boeuf, porc, poulet, tofu (...) On manque vraiment pas de choix.

J'ai essayé le poulet général tao. Je dois dire que c'est un des meilleur que j'ai mangé. Le poulet était bien tendre, légèrement pané, la sauce était suffisamment présente et délicieuse pour bien accompagner le poulet. En accompagnement, du bok Choy frit avec du riz blanc. Je ne suis pas un fan du bok Choy mais ce n'était pas mauvais. Je trouvais que ça goutais rien mais mon amie m'a dit que c'était très goûteux. Le bok Choy en général goûte rien pour moi alors je ne blâme pas la recette. J'aurais préféré quelques légume comme brocoli, carotte, etc.

Ma compagne à prit les nouilles Shangai. Elle a vraiment aimé son repas, tout était goûteux et frais.

Elle a aussi essayé la soupe tonkatsu. Le tout était bien préparé dans un bouillon bien goûteux.

Comme il s'agit d'un restaurant d'hôtel, l'endroit est alors un peu plus huppé qu'un restaurant plus traditionnel et le prix le reflète. La moyenne des repas sont à partir de 22$ en montant. Il m'en a coûté 30$ après taxes pour mon poulet général tao seul, avant pourboire.

Mais le prix amène une touche de qualité. Les ingrédients sont frais et bon.

Dans l'ensemble, je vais y retourner. J'y retournerais probablement plus souvent si c'était plus abordable, mais ce n'est pas non plus un endroit hyper cher, juste légèrement plus que les restaurant standards.","5 star rating"

I was impressed by the venue. I really liked how the place was decorated. The art piece on the wall was neat. I like the color scheme and the layout. 
The prices were a bit high to me but not too too bad. To start off, we had the Tai Chi Gow Dumplings. They were yummy! I was sad that we had only ordered one serving, because I wanted more haha. For the main dish I had the Peking Duck. I wanted to try something totally different than what I normally get. And I was so satisfied with this dish. I would definitely come back to get it again if I could. My bf had the Pad Thai with chicken. I was glad that I did not get that because it was rather disappointing. He thought it was ok.

My husband recently brought me to East for our date night and to my high expectations, it suited perfectly :)
Situated in the famous downtown Renaissance hotel, this pan-asian restaurant contrasts yet also compliments the hotel. 
Our immediate reaction to entering through the separate entrance for the restaurant was the super swanky interior - dark with dimmed lighting, very contemporary with east asian influences. The vibrant red and black décor creates an ambiance which works well for most settings - from the buzzing office party that was happening at the bar area to the more intimate separated dining area where we were seated. The interior is so intricate, you could spend ages staring at it! Prepare to be mesmerized by the gorgeous hand-painted wall of an asian beauty..

Now on to the meal...
We were given a lot of attention and taken very well care of by the staff which even before eating, made us feel comfortable and love the place. Our waiter spent time describing the dishes to us, which ingredients were used, which spices... It was evident to see that this place takes pride in their fresh ingredients and has expert chefs!
We ordered the papaya salad for starters and boy, was it good!! I never expected a salad starter to be this delicious but this really was something else. It is quite spicy but that is what makes it so special.. The contrast between the sweetness from the papaya and the spices create the most delicious combination.

For the main course, we had the Singapore noodles and the sea bass. Both were just as good as they looked (they were excellently presented!) and the spices were to my palate. Since a recent trip to Malaysia, I became accustomed to spicy noodles and have been unable to find them... However, this place did them just right and I am so so SO happy to have discovered it! At least I know where to go next to satisfy my cravings and to take me back down memory lane :):) 
My husband loved the sea bass which was gorgeously garnished and also had a kick to it! 

We did not want to leave the place as we felt so spoilt so we decided to have dessert too! It took time to arrive but it was definitely worth the wait! We were presented with a stunning tray of a type of coconut tart and a hot chocolate soufflé! For a chocolate lover, the soufflé just melted my heart, it was mouth-watering just to look at and tasted even better!! We enjoyed these treats with tea which again was presented extremely well...

Overall, if you want to spoil yourself with some exotic tastes and want to enjoy a relaxing ambiance, this is definitely the place for you! The food is of an extremely high quality with carefully selected ingredients and prepared with pride :)
I cannot wait for my next visit to East Restaurant!! Thank you for making our experience an unforgettable one :):):)","5 star rating"

The maki roll is not bad but not enough sushi rice and too much cucumber. The steam dumplings wrap is too thick. The baos in the same steam basket are not at a consistent qualify. Some baos are harder than others. It's like the baos have been out for awhile or they are not steamed enough.

Easily my best meal in Montreal, East offers a phenomenal dining/drinking experience. The atmosphere is fun and fabulous, the service was exemplary, the drinks were perfection, and I was truly shocked and surprised at how delicious the food was in this non-traditional Asian restaurant. I started with the Peking Duck Bao - two large bao crunchy and umami and well spiced. Then moved on to the Spicy Tartar Maki - enormous and delicious with lots of fresh fish flavor. My only complaint is that the maki were too large leaving you the choice of biting through nori or overstuffing your face. 

The drinks were in fact beyond perfection. The Green Lantern was an herbaceous sake delight and the East a vibrant balance of flavor and texture (I ordered mine light on the syrup to contain the sweetness - your mileage may vary). The bartender was a delight - not only providing prompt, friendly, efficient service but also discussing the options and techniques available to a good mixologist. And the atmosphere was both welcoming and entertaining - if I didn't have other places to be I could have hung out here all evening.

It isn't often I get to sing a song of unrelenting praise. Dining at East offered me such an opportunity.","5 star rating"

We arrived around 8pm on a Thursday night and were met with a buzzing atmosphere around the bar area. We were quickly taken to the dining section in the back and were seated in a half booth (non-booth chair was weirdly designed and super uncomfy if you slid the whole way back...minus half a star). Upon a quick glance at the menu, I was surprised at some of the ridiculous prices ($14 for one small bao, $30 for a bulgogi, etc). After trying to order 3 dishes and being told that they were sold out of them all, I went for the overpriced bibimbap and hubby for the overpriced lamb curry as well as the 'amazing' extremely overpriced dumpling platter to share (see a trend here?). When the dumplings came out, I was immediately unimpressed. Having been told that these were super phenomenally amazing (major upsell), I couldn't see or really taste anything phenomenal to be honest. When you pay almost $3 PER DUMPLING ($33 for 12), you really expect the sun and moon to explode into your mouth but nothing other than a monotonous flavor was present (you could barely differentiate the four different flavors presented either). Other than this dish, the two main dishes were ok but nothing special at all. We ended up paying $167 with tax and tip for these three dishes and two drinks - one of the most painful payments I've ever made (I'm all for spending a lot on great food but this all fell super short and felt like a major rip off). Will definitely not be back....","2 star rating"

First, the shrimp on my rice dishes was so over cooked that I couldn't get it out of its shell. Next, the rice was overlooked to to the point at it was chewy and barely suitable.

Thank God I did! It, now it's  the first place I Eat on all Montreal trips.  
The food is  amazing.  All of it!   So flavorful and  delicious.  
The happy hour parties on W-Fri are great.  Happy people, happy staff and it's rocking with an awesome crowd. 
The Manager is great, the staff and bartenders are gorgeous and the dudes arnt so bad either if that's  your thing!   
Decided to hit happy hour my last day on a 4 night trip.   Thinking I would have a drink and head out on the town. That Didn't happen.  The manager Guluilami (sp) had staff giving out free samples of food and apps.  He's always on top of what's happening at this place as I sit at the bar.  All of it so good.  Keeping everyone drinking and happy!  Than he had one of the beautiful  bartenders make a giant bowel of a white Sangria , of course samples to all who wanted one.  Not a white Sangria guy but this was awesome.  Had to get the recipe.  
The happy hour crowd dwindles down around 7-7:30 and becomes a nice quiet romantic sheik restaurant!

The dining atmosphere was a little upbeat lounge almost ""clubby"" feeling but not obnoxious if that makes sense. I had a green curry and the papaya salad. Yum! The papaya salad was more thai style so not a punch in the face spice but more manageable and tastey. All in all, I would return for the delicious curry and salad.","4 star rating"

I reserved via Yelp message and was replied to within minutes, which is so reassuring when you're booking for a group. 

Our group ordered a couple different dishes to share - the mango salad was to die for, and the imperial rolls were fresh and light to start. The gluten free pad thai was delish, loved the flavours, to me they were just as they should be, tart and yummy and the tofu and egg were well cooked. My friends loved the peanut chicken, and chicken green curry - I tasted the sauces and enjoyed for sure - and we all enjoyed the veggie pad sieu.

This chef knows what she is doing. This is my favourite food ever! Green curry. This is 100 percent; without a doubt; hands down ... the best of the best Thai food in this city ... in this province ... in the entire Occident. You'd have to go so far West, young man, that you will have had reached the East once again. You'd have to travel far and wide to get close to the excellence and authenticity of this Thai green curry. Ask to speak to the boss lady ... ask her to make you the same vegetarian Thai green curry that she makes for Raj ... that's me. My green curry is especially made for me and it is 100% strictly vegetarian. You won't find this elsewhere. Voilà, the sublime excellence, nuance and harmony of Thai flavour. 

Have you heard of the King of Siam? Well this is the story of the King and I ... whilst monarchic tradition and hegemony, in my humble opinion, begets a most anachronistic and antiquated and deleterious convention of social inequity, popular subservience, enslavement of the intellect, royal incest and unwarranted elitist hegemony ... notwithstanding all that ... sometimes the people just want you to rule them with an iron fisted donkey punch to the kidneys. Does it make sense that people would disregard their seething sectarian hatred for one another in order to unite in love, harmony and servility - all the way down in the dirt - beneath some arbitrary monarch? They barely have food and water but what they really need is pomp and circumstance and royal pageantry. So, basically, take a country where there is a lot of civil unrest based on ethnic, linguistic and / or religious differences and just establish a monarchy. That should solve all the problems in the entire world. Yes, indeed, the penultimate solution is to unify people with all of their hatred for one another by somehow galvanising their allegiance and support and loyalty in one lofty, unelected, unaccountable and arbitrary megalomaniac of a person, in relation to whom, they should all feel inferior. They would need to obey and love this monarch who would tell them all what they can and cannot do and how and how not to think. C'mon Rama IX, that is a bit amateurish ... not very fly for a Thai guy. 

I love you, Red Shirts! SOCIALISM!

Monarchism precipitates the need for the subjects being ruled over; to, in effect, maintain an individual and societal state of suspended disbelief. Disbelief in the primacy of the individual in relation to the welfare of society, disbelief in one's individual agency and authority, disbelief in the equality of all people and disbelief in good governance, true democracy, accountability and transparency. 

Monarchism perpetuates old anachronisms such as the concept of race and the idea that one ethnicity can be superior to another ethnicity and therefore those born to this royal family or that royal family are naturally born to rule over the obviously inferior masses. It perpetuates classism; in our modern society one should not be expected to defer to another or hold another above oneself simply because of birth. It perpetuates discrimination based bullshit; most of us cannot become King or Queen of Canada. It also perpetuates discrimination based on gender in the case of male primogeniture. Fuck that shit! I'm all about the VOX POPULI!! Let's hear it for equality, folks. 

Monarchy makes it impossible to separate church & state as the monarch is usually both head of state and head of the church. Sometimes the monarch is a god or demigod. Isn't Queen Elisabeth like Jesus' second cousin or something? Wait would that make her also her own father? Talk about incest! The Emperor of Japan is like a Shinto God. The King of Thailand is like an incarnation of the Hindu avatar Rama! What? 

Monarchism is also problematic for the monarchs themselves what with all the incest and hemophilia. They also have a hard time (poor little rich kid) growing up, what with the dysfunctional household and obvious abnormal childhood. 

Monarchism is also very expensive and modern monarchy remains unaccountable to taxpayers. Britons pay over £100 million per annum and that number may not even be the ""real McCoy"" as the finances are exempt from the Access to Information Act. Canada spends about 250$ million each year; not including our annual gifting to the crown of twenty purebred horses from the RCMP. Each horse costs about a cool 20 million each. 

As long as people remain subjects of a monarch and not citizens of a republic their political and social attitudes will inevitably retain a certain mediaeval idiocy which has no place in modernity. 

Ultimately, monarchy (the monarch, monarchism and the institution) makes the country which they rule over appear backwards and ill suited for a just society that ostensibly is conducive to a secular, multicultural, and multilingual civil state. 

Off with their figurative heads. Get it? Figure head? Go figure ... it's all about the economy, stupid","5 star rating"

The decor was modern and the atmosphere cozy. It wasn't too loud which was so nice because we didn't have to yell to talk to each other. It's probably because it wasn't too crowded but also because the rooms are divided in two and the acoustics are good.","5 star rating"

Their Pad Thai really might be the best in the city (the only reason it's not getting less stars) but everything else is just good/OK and not worth the price. 

On top of that, the service is awkward and lacklustre. I think they had one man working the kitchens on the night we dined there because our orders came out 5 minutes apart... and we were a group of 6. That meant that some of us sat with untouched food in front of us and got to watch it go cold for 20-30 minutes.

Beautiful and cozy decor! This restaurant was recommended last year by a colleague of mine and I'm so happy that I finally visited. Absolutely must try! 

I would start with the salads, oh the salads! The papaya and green mango salads are delicious and of very good size! I got scared by the statement of our host that the hot version of the papaya salad is burning and ordered it mild, fortunately it was still hot enough to be considered authentic. The dried shrimp added an extra flavour I'm still dreaming about.

The mains can be ordered with vegetables or different choices of meat and fish. The Pad Thai was delicious, it is served with a small set of soya sauce, authentic red chilly paste and ground peanuts, so you can flavour it up to your taste. I had the creamy green curry with scallops, it was so good that I ate some of the creamy sauce with my spoon, I could have easily chosen the vegetarian version of the dish as it was really filling. The very classical Thai dessert coconut sticky rice with mango is served with wild black rice, another point for the chef. 

I'm also impressed with the wine list. I have to admit I did not spend too much time to look at the reds, because the whites were so well chosen to match the food, selection of reislings, gewürztraminer etc. The owners have invested time in perfect wine paring options for their customers. 

My dinner visit was on Easter Sunday and the restaurant was not packed at all. I made a reservation using the Yelp booking service for the first time and I guess it is better to book in advance just in case. With or without a reservation I'm coming back for more coconut curry!

However, when we showed up at 5:45 pm, the host simply told us that we had no reservation. He refused to check the reservation list to see what happened and was not apologetic. Even after showing him that a call was made, he simply said he wouldn't seat us. The restaurant was basically empty at that time. 

This caused my friends and I to have to search for another restaurant last minute and was quite frustrating. When I called, I was told my reservation was confirmed. 

Clearly, this restaurant is not interested in customer service and is just relying on the success of a high profile review. I'd ""pick"" another Thai restaurant.

Pick Thai doesn't seem to be well advertised, which is a real shame! 
It's located across the street from Vendome metro - so convenient!

Here's a summary of our experience:

1. The staff were very accommodating (I changed my reservation from 7:00pm to 7:30pm) and friendly on the phone before we arrived.  

2. When we arrived, we were greeted and seated at our table almost immediately. Service is offered in both French and English with menus available in both languages. The decor is very impressive. It's upscale without being pretentious and the music they play is very mellow and unassuming.

3. We ordered 2 appetizers (satay chicken and Tom Kah Kai soup) and a glass of white wine to start. Everything was brought to us reasonably quickly and the food was perfect temperature. We were very impressed by the peanut sauce that came with the satay sticks and the soup was equally as impressive. 

4. For our main courses, we ordered the Pad Thai and the Thai Red Curry. Both were brought to us quickly after we finished eating the appetizers and were absolutely delicious. The portions were very generous - we even had some left over to take home!

5. The waiter was attentive and checked in on us at all the right times without being overbearing. 

6. Prices were reasonable. About 65.00 before tip for 2 people (appetizers, wine, and main courses). 

I definitely recommend Pick Thai!","5 star rating"

The soups were very good, just the right amount of spice and filled with goodness. But that was the only good thing. The pad Thai was like past and blah!! The red curry chicken was barely ok and expensive for what you got. Would never eat their food again","2 star rating"

The prices are relatively high for Thai food, but so is the quality. My food was uniformly delicious. They served a coconut milk and lemongrass soup that was fantastic.

There was still a line, but not too long. We were seated by 9:10, and ordered shortly thereafter.

The menu is simple. Just 4 starter options and 5 types of noodles. We wanted to get the beef noodle soup, but unfortunately they were out. So maybe don't go right before they close? I heard that is one of their best dishes and was thoroughly disappointed that it was not available anymore. Instead, we went with the zhajiang noodles, Dan Dan noodles, and Lan Zhou specialty. Their portions are very large, with the large enough for at least two people. I didn't think that this place was as good as everyone was raving about it. The noodles were the only good part. They were perfectly made and had the right texture and chewiness. For all of the noodle dishes, I felt like it lacked flavor. The only thing that provided the flavor was the hot sauce, which was wonderful. There was also a good amount of vegetables and meat in everything, I just felt like the flavor was not there. 

We also ordered a side dish: the edamame and pickled vegetables. That was probably the best dish of the night. It was perfectly salty and the pickled vegetables were delicious. 

At the end, we had some leftovers and it cost extra to have a take out box. The servers were fine, clearly overworked. They had no time to talk and was constantly rushing to get to the next table.

We have been to this noodle shop a couple of times at different times throughout the day during our visit due to convenience and also how good this place is!

I've tried a variety of options from this establishment, which I'll review down below:

Appetizers (Spicy Cucumber Mix & Seaweed Potato Salad): These salads come with the noodle combos and they are nice and refreshing! For the Spicy Cucumber Mix - the cucumber chunks are portioned well and there is a mild amount of spiciness, and this subtle spice and refreshing crunch is a good compliment to the nutty flavor of peanut topping, delicious! For the Seaweed Potato Salad - The julienned potato soaks up the seaweed flavor nicely! The seaweed flavor is similar to the ones you get the market, a sweet flavor with a subtle hint of spiciness afterwards. Both delicious appetizer salads to the main!

Zha Jiang Noodles ($18): A scrumptious plate of noodles with a good variety of veggies and nice zha jiang sauce of ground pork. The waiter recommended a noodle thickness of 3 and above for this particular dish. After mixing, every bite gives you a nice plethora of textures from the crunch of the carrot, refreshing taste of the shredded cucumber, and meaty pieces of ground pork. They give you a good amount of food for the price, and it's delicious!

Traditional Hand Pulled Beef Noodle ($17): Yum - I love this dish! The beef chunks and slices in this bowl are hearty, tender, and meaty, and not too thick! The soup itself has good beefy flavor, and combined with the chili oil that they give you, elevates the complexities of the flavor to another level. I personally love thinner noodle thicknesses, as this type of thickness can more easily absorb the broth's beefy flavor as well as small flakes of beef. These bowls are filling with the additional egg on top and are consistently delicious on any day, but would definitely slap on a cold rainy day!

Overall, I would say that Nouilles de Lan Zhou is a solid place for some delicious hand pulled Chinese noodles! You will definitely get filled up here for less than $20 CAD and that's a good deal in my book. Whenever I'm back in Montreal, I would definitely like to revisit to give this place another try!","5 star rating"

More of a thick flat noodle kind of person? Yeah they have that too.

Do yourself a favor and go do the lineup like the other folks and enjoy the show as they slap dem freshly made pulled noodle in front of your face while you wait. Once in there, order anything from the menu as pretty much everything there is good. You get to choose the thickness of your noodles so if you want the thin one, go ahead order that. More of a thick flat noodle kind of person? Yeah they have that too. You can hear the noodle slapping while sitting in the restaurant which reminds me of my dad whenever he'd whip out the jumper cables to hit me, good times. Anyway, the broth is good, go give it a try. You won't regret it.","5 star rating"

America/Canada.  They allow you to choose different bowl sizes and only a few variety, while the small kitchen goes to work upfront.

We wanted to try this place due to the high reviews and ratings we saw. The menu is very simple - they only have 4 noodle choices consists of Zhajiang noodle, Dan Dan noodle, beef noodle soup, and vegetarian noodle soup. You can also order side appetizers. They make their hand pulled noodles fresh in the front where everyone can see the process. It's so therapeutic to watch. You can pick between different levels of thickness for your noodles. 

We ordered the Dan Dan Noodle. I would say to pick a thickness somewhere between the middle for dry noodles. We also got beef shank cold appetizer, spicy cucumber, and seaweed potato salad. Everything was so good. I love starting with cold appetizer to stimulate your appetite. The Dan Dan Noodle was the best I've had. The noodle was made to perfection and the sauce was so flavorful. We ordered a size medium and that was enough to shared amongst two people. The tea leaf egg included in the noodle was also very tasty. 

I don't think they take reservations. We went around 1-2pm on a weekday and waited about 30-45 minutes to get seated. It is definitely worth the wait!","5 star rating"

This restaurant has the best noodles I've ever had in my life. Soft, smooth, and fresh- you can definitely taste the difference.

I got the combo #1 with size #5 thickness with the cucumber salad as a side and a tea egg. It was delicious. Came out piping hot with huge portions (I unfortunately could not finish it), rich broth, and an overall well balanced and incredibly flavourful meal.  There was almost always a lineup when we were eating and I know why- Nouilles de lan Zhou knows what's up!! Service was efficient and straightforward too. It also adds to the experience seeing the chefs make the noodles in front of you. They work hard and it pays off.

Note: I ordered a medium but it felt like an extra large. Small is definitely enough for one person.","5 star rating"

We stopped here for a quick lunch on our last day in Montreal. It's located inside a Chinese supermarket (which is on the bottom floor) with the restaurant on the top floor. You can see people making the noodles in the kitchen as you sit down.

The place is small with limited seating and I don't know if there's A/C, but the value is through the roof! An extra large bowl is more than enough to share between two people. You can also pick the noodles you'd like. It's definitely vegetarian friendly too with their options. For a great noodle soup spot; give this a shot!","5 star rating"

Nouilles de Lan Zhou is the exception. I couldn't wait to write this review. Someone else on Yelp described these as the best noodles they've had in Canada, and I think I have to agree. I got the spicy beef noodle soup combo with #5 noodles (different numbers correspond with different widths of noodle). The combo comes with a choice of a small side (I got the spicy cucumber) and a tea egg.

What do you want from a spicy bowl of beef noodle soup on a cold Montreal day? You want something that will warm you up, fill you up, and leave you satisfied. This does all that, but then it does more. These noodles are absolutely perfect. Just the right amount of chew, with their fresh doughy flavour apparent even under the delicious broth. And the broth is delicious. If you get it spicy, you're getting it with hot oil, so keep that in mind if you want something lighter. But get it hot, you'll be glad you did. 

I'll be here every day for lunch until I leave at the end of the week.","5 star rating"

The noodles are handmade fresh at the front of the restaurant which is so very impressive. There are quite a variety of sizes of noodles from very thin to very thick. 
They have a vegetarian noodle soup. The broth is like a corn chowder which sounds strange but is actually so good. I added some black vinegar and spicy sauce to mine and it was just as good if not better. We got the combo and got the shredded potato and edamame side dishes. Both delicious. The tea eggs that came with the veggie noodle soup were so flavorful. 
The thick noodles were so perfectly made. It's hard to describe but the texture and the flavor were perfect.

But it's worth the wait, the noodles are DELICIOUS. The guy at the window makes each batch of noodles per order so not only is it fresh, but you get to choose the width of the noodles you want. The broth was divine. Super flavorful and you just don't get tired of it! I got medium spicy as someone who can minimally tolerate spicy, so that was super bearable. There's more hot chili on your table for you to add.

From the street view, you can watch the chefs hand pull the noodles and there was a line wrapped around the street, but it went pretty quickly. One major note to mention is there is no air conditioning, so on a hot summer night like when we went you will sweat. We ordered the Large Special Nouilles de Beouf Lanzhou (Traditional LanZhou Hand-pull Beef Noodle)  Combo with Concombre épicé (Cucumber Mix with Home Made Spicy Sauce) and the Large Nouilles DanDan (Dan Dan Noodle). I like how you can choose your noodle thickness! The food was delicious and we got the spicy chili oil on the side to add in on our own. I wish there was more beef in the Large Special Nouilles de Beouf Lanzhou but it was very flavorful and good! Both dishes were great choices. The one downside other than the air conditioner problem was that our waitress did not check in and we needed water refills. Our waitress didn't even come by when we were done with the check, so my fiancé paid up front with the host. Overall, it was good and I would recommend it!","4 star rating"

We were staying right on the edge of Chinatown, so how could we NOT have at least one meal there? I did some sleuthing on Yelp and found this place and kept it on my radar all week long. Finally, towards the end of our trip, we stopped in. 

(No reservations taken here btw.)

We went for lunch. We were like the third party in the line forming outside the restaurant. We figured this place would be worth the wait given the Yelp reviews. Not sure we would have waited in line had we been further back - mostly because I'm not a wait-in-line person. But actually, the restaurant, though small, has a good number of tables and seating crammed into it. Also I noted that customers get seated, order, eat and leave - they didn't hang out inordinately long after finishing their meal so tables generally turn pretty quickly. 

Also - PRO TIP: if you're a smaller party - 1-4 - and are ok eating counter style (all in a row), let the hostess know and snag counter seats (a few right inside the front door and a lower counter seating area in the back of the place) - likely you will get seated quicker or maybe even without a wait. Also - if your larger party (5+) is up for being split up (highly recommend), let the hostess know and you'll likely be seated sooner instead of having to wait for tables to be put together which is harder to do because of how small the place is. 

We were seated within about 15 minutes which was fine by me. :)

The place is clean and tastefully decorated. The servers are friendly and efficient. Loved seeing the ""chefs"" / noodle makers hard at work at their craft, pounding, kneading, stretching their noodle dough, putting on a culinary show for the sidewalk audience watching through the front window. So cool! This IS the REAL DEAL - AN AUTHENTIC MADE-RIGHT-BEFORE-YOUR-EYES CHINESE NOODLE SHOP! You can taste the goodness with your eyes!

What more do you need to convince you to GO?!

The menu is focused and straightforward. Not a lot of options to choose from - see my menu pics - THAT'S A PLUS ACTUALLY.  This place sticks to cranking out what they do best. The menu has pictures to guide you. There are a number of side dishes you can order a la carte (to share) or you can get a combo meal that includes the noodle dish and a side. Some noodle dishes come in small, medium, or large sizes - beware of the large size! It is GINORMOUS NO LIE. 

What you CAN decide on is the thickness of noodle you want in your dish. Wow. What a cool concept. There's a whole menu page (see my pic) devoted to the different noodle thickness options (you can also order a side of extra noodles). We asked the server what her recommendation was for noodle thickness (she said #3 is the most popular) but if you like your noodles thick (like I do) you can go up in thickness to a 4, 5, 6 or even 7!

Party of 3 - I had the Nouilles de Zhajiang which is the ""Noodles with homemade pork sauce."" I wanted something not soupy so I went with this. (They also have Dan Dan Noodles which looked yummy too, if you like a more peanut-y taste.) If you're familiar with Korean cuisine, the Zhajiang noodle dish I ordered is the classic Korean jajangmyun noodle dish that's typically served with noodles, potatoes and onions in a thick black bean paste/sauce. Soooooooo good. See my pic - a very very hearty delicious dish with super fresh ingredients. And lots of them! No skimping here! My dish was accompanied by a small bowl of broth. 

Both my traveling companions had the Nouilles de Légumes (Noodles with Vegetables) that included a boiled egg and loads of fresh veggies including broccoli, corn and baby bok choy cabbage in an amazingly flavorful broth (almost like a Pho style dish). SO GOOD.  

We ordered our noodles as combos and had the spicy cucumber side dish - delicious, crunchy with a spicy bite to it. Perfect accompaniment to our noodle dishes. Try it!

OUR ENTIRE MEAL WAS PERFECTION. We were so happy we stopped in during our trip. Had we discovered this place earlier, there is no doubt we would have been here multiple times - THAT good. 

THE PRICE FOR OUR MEAL WAS VERY REASONABLE FOR WHAT WE HAD, for the fact that the noodles were freshly handmade, the veggies and meat were fresh and high quality and the service was spot on. 

I so wish we had an authentic noodle shop like this (or anything even close to the quality of this place) in our hometown Chinatown. Sad face. 

HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. 

For dessert or a little sweet treat palette-cleanser after our meal, we walked to Patisserie Coco literally one block up Blvd St Laurent - O. M. G. SHEER HEAVEN I TELL YOU. (See my review and pics - you are in for a TREAT - you will be a kid in a candy store!)

Nouilles de Lan Zhou and a Patisserie Coco cap-off - a double treat that I wouldn't mind repeating over and over and over (and over and over and...) again!

Until next time, Vieux Montreal!","5 star rating"

Soon after, three groups joined the line behind us. We all had to wait 15 mins for them to fix a machine which none of us seemed to mind. We were seated and chose our dishes. My party chose the beef noodle soup (spicy and non spicy) as well as another noodle dish with edamame, minced pork, and other veggies. I've never had beef noodle soup but I feel as though the broth was not as flavorful as I imagined. To me it tasted watered down. The noodles and beef were nice. I like that we got to choose our noodle thickness. My group got a mix of sizes 1, 2, 5, and 6. The service here was really good and the servers were super nice! The prices were great but I don't think that I would come back.","3 star rating"

I ordered the vegetable noodle soup (not combo) and my boyfriend ordered the traditional beef noodle soup (combo). He wanted to add beef tendon to his order but it was all sold out. His combo came with a choice of side dish. We decided to go with the potato seaweed salad. That side dish was a huge portion for one person.

Rest assured, I was not disappointed with my decision as the Beef Noodle Soup I ordered was made to perfection! The noodles were handmade right there in the store and they gave you 5 different levels of thickness that you can choose for your noodles.

  The restroom situation makes you take a short jaunt up a non-working escalator and a few turns later are the restrooms.  The men's was clean but the odor of the NY subway on a hot day lingered strongly.  You need a code to get into the restrooms too.  The servers will provide these.  The cost of our meal was quite cheap too.  That was awesome!

However upon arriving to this hand-pulled noodle house (to the 30 min wait line at around 6:30pm on a Friday night), we thought the dining area isn't bad at all rated under my ""Chinatown"" standard tbh. Yes the seatings are smaller and closer together like in typical Food stalls in Asia so be prepared if you don't like that sort of environment. All dine-in patrons must show proof of vaccination upon seating. The waitstaff was swift and accommodated us with a 4-top table so we can put our babe away from people. The menu has large, realistic pictures which makes it easy to order. The noodles come in 5-6 sizes from ramen thin to 2/3inch thick. You can choose S,M, or Lg portion and there's an option to combo side salad and tea-marinaded boiled egg.  I also appreciate that they took out appetizers really quickly and order came out fast. Once you're done just pay up front (cash/debit only) 

We ordered medium bowls of traditional spicy beef Lan Zhou noodle size 4, and spicy beef tendon noodle size 3, along with edamame with pickled veg salad and a cold spicy beef slices. The cold beef slices was ok as it wasn't super tender but not the worst I've had. The edamame was delicious with a hint of spice and nuttiness from the fermented cabbage. The noodle was great like any hand-pulled places, the broth though was light but flavorful with nice good quality beef. I especially loved the beef tendon as they are so tender and has a bit more rich broth flavor. 

Very affordable price too of Canadian$14-16 a bowl. It's a steal!

We figured this place was pretty authentic and knew we had to try it. 

We ordered the classic Lanzhou beef noodles and zhajiang mian. We also ordered a side of cucumbers and beef. What I loved about this place was you could choose from a variety of noodle types (thin- thick) and adjust the spice. Our dishes came minutes within ordering and the warm spicy broth was perfect for the chilly weather. The noodles had a nice bite to them, not too chewy and not too hard. The broth was light yet rich with beef flavor and spice. My dad is a native of this region in China where these noodles get their name from and he said these were the best lanzhou noodles he's had in North America. We also ordered the Jazhiang mian which is a bean paste and pork topping. It was very savory and came with a bowl of soup to thin out the sauce to your liking. We loved that dish as well. These were all pretty large portions even for the smaller sizes and are definitely worth the price.

This place is perpetually crowded, but thankfully they've expanded seating into the restaurant next door so they can seat more than a few tables. It's situated about the asian grocery store that I go to so sometimes waiting near the entrance is a bit hectic with the in and out + the people standing by the window watching the noodle pulling masters at work. 

It's great that you can get whatever shape/size noodle you want since they're made completely fresh. The standard beef noodle soup is very tasty and made with thin slices of beef. The large is quite large and should be able to satisfy any noodle soup appetite.  I also love the tendon beef noodles as the meat is a bit more thick and tender . Tea egg and spicy cucumber salad are my favorite sides. 

I'm glad they're doing delivery/takeout and I'll be glad to eat in person when they can reopen. Noodle soups are a must for a winter that lasts 5 months!","4 star rating"

Texture is great and you have many choices for the thickness of the noodle (5 levels?). I think the thin or 2nd level thickness were the best. We tried the thickest level and thought that was too thick. 

The line easily gets long however it moves fast since service is quick. You get your food within minutes of ordering. Only limiting factor is how fast each customer eats. 

The beef noodle is the best item with a clear broth that is very flavorful. You can select to get spicy or nonspicy. I was also loving the marinated edamame. The spicy cucumber was just ok. 

I tried the vegetables broth and it wasn't that good. The noodle is still nicely al dente! 

They take credit card, located in Chinatown above a Chinese market. 
Sitting next to the bar was a nice treat as we got to watch them make the noodles. 

It's Michelin bib gourmand.

Firstly, the food is really good. The tea eggs are to die for! So delicious, flavorful, and aromatic. The noodles are fantastic and the soup is great. I could tell the ingredients were fresh. 

It's quite cramped, which I didn't like very much. I'm an anxious person and have a hard time in crowds, so the atmosphere was quite stressful for me. If you're anything like me, I would recommend pick-up or delivery even after the pandemic. 

The service is pretty fast. The staff are friendly and hardworking.

Hand pulled noodles of the flat kind or the round kind and you get to choose your width/thickness, respectively. 

The noodles are simple, al dente, and satisfying. You can watch as they slam the dough in the front to make the noodles! 

A fellow diner recommended getting the special lanzhou beef noodle combo because you get a bang for your buck. $13CAD for a veggie app and noodle soup that comes with their hard boiled tea egg. Get it spicy or sans spicy. Spicy isn't really spicy to be honest but adds to the flavor. If someone wanted to go again, I'd go again and order the braised beef tendon noodles (it's a chef recommended dish too!) 

The line gets long here so be prepared to wait! It's a tiny hole in the wall that shares it's space with an escalator to the grocery store in the basement.

Just like my opening line states it was ok.

Yea it was cool to see the guys hand pull the noodles in the window and it was cool to see another china town in another city, but that is it .
For me:
1.The wait in line because of VERY limited seating.
2.The VERY cramped seating.
3.The customers for the downstairs grocery store walking through the middle of the restaurant because the stairs are in the middle of the restaurant.

Just kind of took away from the experience and made it uncomfortable having to constantly move and lean out of the way.

When it was time to pay I was not allowed to pay at the table , I had to stand up and take 2 steps toward the register which I could reach seating at the table. 
This sounds like no big deal but were I had to stand to pay was in the one path to get to all the tables so I had to stand side ways to allow people to pass me.

While the broth had a nice kick to it, it was way too salty, and the beef slices were thin, a bit scanty, and very dry and chewy - not tender and melt-in-your-mouth like I've had at other places.

Also, I did not realize there was such a range of noodle thickness, and while I showed the waitress a picture of the noodles I wanted, it seems there was a miscommunication and I ended up with extra-wide noodles, which, while fresh, heavily dominated over the thin beef slices in terms of texture.

I ordered the Special Nouilles de boeuf Lanzhou (large) to share with my boyfriend + Lanzhou Beouf Hoison. The texture of the hand pulled noodles was perfect and hands down best noodles we have had so far. How I wish I lived in Montreal so I could have these more often.

Both times there was a line to grab a table. The inside is small with two seats at the noodle bar and about 30 seats for the rest.

The menu is short and sweet (less than 10 items). Again, the menu out front is different than the one they give you inside. Look for the combo option!

Trip #1
I dropped in Sunday for a pre-dinner and was surprised to see it packed.
- Lan Zhou special beef noodles combo ($10.97 small) - you choose a side, get a tea egg and spiciness. I picked the spicy cucumber salad which had a satisfyingly crunchy bite and touch of heat. The noodles were fresh, chewy and toothsome. Broth was clean tasting and homey. Think simplicity; they let the noodles shine.

Trip #2
Second time, we dropped in on a Tuesday evening (around 7:00pm).
- Lan Zhou special beef noodles combo ($10.97 small)
- Noodle with homemade pork sauce ($10.99) - noodles are homemade and again, toothsome bite. Crazy amount in one bowl (it's a medium). Pork was way too salty.

And that's perfectly fine! My mother loves 牛肉面湯 (beef noodle soup) and we figured we might as well eat here while we were visiting Montreal. The beauty of the beef noodle soup here is that you can choose the width and size of your noodles because they make their noodles in-house. That's amazing.

There are so many widths and sizes to choose from, my indecisive heart almost could not handle it. I opted for 二細 (""2-xì"" lit. ""2-thin"") which was cylindrical and relatively thick, and it was just right for me. My mother got the 寬(""kuān"" lit. ""wide"") which was definitely wide relative to my 2-xì. They were both good and chewy. Our bowls were huge! Makes the price definitely worth it.

I don't know if it was a function of the noodles in general being the soup for long, but when I was helping my mom finish her kuān noodles, they seemed to have dissolved slightly into the soup, making them more doughy than I wanted.

The clientele comprised mainly college students, solo or in pairs, which is just as well - the seat I got for myself faces the wall, which doesn't create much of a romantic setting. Kitchen is right there within your sight and earshot. Your dinner is brought to you pretty swiftly (need the fast turnover of tables, baby!)

Thankfully it means that the turnover is quick and you get a turn soon.

The menu is small, will less than 5 soup options and several noodle types for mix and match. There are some small side-dishes that can be ordered as an add-on.

we waited about 25-30 minutes in line outside and i guess that added to our expectations. but i mean, if people are going to stand in line for this place, it SHOULD live up to the expectation, no? 

we got the beef noodles in 2 styles of noodle: moxi (thinnest round) and da quan (widest flat). i'm a big fan of hand pulled noodles because they tend to have a much nicer glutinous chewy texture. but these were not that. the moxi had zero toothsomeness, you may as well be biting into air. the da quan had more chew but not much; i found it a little gummy to be honest. the broth for the beef noodles was... fine. a little weak in my opinion, but i guess i just prefer a really rich beefy flavor. the chili oil had the numby kind of spice by the way. the smalls were more than enough noodle for a lunch-sized portion. we also got a small dan dan to try which had a thicker round noodle and dang was that disappointing. that was the gummiest noodle i've ever eaten in my life. the minced pork sauce was great but ruined by that gummy gummy noodle. i hated it. 

it's super crowded as others have mentioned. got there around 2p on a saturday, waited in line, ate, left around 3p, and the line was still long. i personally would not wait in line for this ever again. if there was zero line and i was craving noodles and i just happened to be right in front of it, then i'd eat it. otherwise, try elsewhere. i personally wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way for this.","3 star rating"

I am glad I tried this noodle place as it was on my Montreal's chinatown bucket list.  I enjoyed watching the guy making the noodle in the front window.

I recommend it if you want authentic beef noodles.","4 star rating"

Get ready to wait, restaurant is very small and always a constant flow of clients. I waited 30-45 minutes.

You can pick the thickness of your noodles! So you know that the noodles are made fresh.

Highly, highly recommend, delicious.

Plus, you get a show of them making the noodles in the window while walking downtown St Laurent. 

The flavour of the spicy beef soup was spot on (spicy enough to kill germs but not you), the noodles were cooked perfectly and fills you right up. They also have a veggie broth version. Basically pick the soup based, spice level and the noddle size. When they first opened that was literally the only choices you had. They now have a slight more updated menu, but I still stick to the basics. Why change a classic!

This time around I got a large to take out (as per new rules) and share at home. Normally I would only get a small and not even finish when I would be downtown. Need to go there when extra hungry....","4 star rating"

I ordered their special Nouilles De Boeuf Lanzhou which is their most popular item on the menu! My husband and I shared a Large Bowl which was more then enough for two people. The server asks you to pick your noodle size and spice level. We picked their regular sized noodles and chose for it to be spicy. Servers were prompt and helpful in explaining the menu!

The cucumber, like most reviewers said, aren't that good but that's just a small side dish anyway. Lacks salt and spice. The special beef noodle soup is out of this world though. The broth, first of all, is so hearty and flavorful. I ordered the 2nd smallest circular noodles and thought it was still slightly big. I'd go with the smallest noodles or the smallest flat noodles, just based on texture. The taste is so good though. 

Also, when you walk in, the bowls that you think are the Large bowls are actually Medium! I'm a big eater but the medium bowl was more than enough. Serving portions are huge!! There was a line out the door but it goes by quickly, especially with smaller parties.","5 star rating"

They have Small, Medium, Large sizes and my friend and I split a medium but the bowl looked huge. It actually was a lot of broth but not as many noodles as you would think. We weren't super hungry so the medium was a perfect size for us to split. The beef broth was clear, flavorful and had a nice sweet tanginess. You can customize the thickness of the noodles and we just chose regular which looks like spaghetti noodles. The beef was thinly cut and tender.

Delicious, hearty and filling - a bowl of beef noodles will warm you up during the cold winter months. And the best part is the noodle shop also has a downstairs escalator that goes to an Asian supermarket so you can pick up some drinks or snacks on your way out.

We were lucky to arrive early as the shop is small so seating would be hard to get later. 
The menu offered a variety of noodles and allows one to pick the thickness and style of noodles for the dish. The portion size can also be selected as well. We both picked the shop's specialty which is called ""special nouilles de boeuf"" with flat noodles and in a medium size, but different thickness levels. For the level of spiciness, we both went with mild. 

The food arrived shortly and both medium size bowls were quite big with plenty of noodles and a decent serving of beef. The noodles has a nice chewy texture and the broth was light and refreshing with hints of chili oil as I only asked for mild. The downside was that my noodles stuck together because I did not stir it in the beginning to separate it. 

It was quite chilly the day we went so the noodles warmed us both up.

There are not many seats, and consequently we waited about 30 minutes to be seated as a party of 4, but I would say that it was certainly worth the wait.

Something unique about this place is that you can choose the type of noodles that you would like, and this ranges from both the type of noodle (round or flat) as well as the thickness. It's worth noting that your noodles are actually just one long noodle!!

My friend got the Dan Dan noodles, which she said were reminiscent of her home back in China- to which our other Chinese friend agreed strongly with. I got the Beef Noodle Special with thick flat noodles, as did my friend- it hit the spot on this cold day, and was super flavorful with the spicy chili oil in addition to a rich broth and slices of beef.

I would always be so tempted by the delicious waft of a warming soup bowl from the various places downtown filling the air but whenever inquiring on whether their vegetarian soup bowl uses an actual vegetarian broth, I would get a negative answer. 

By chance, I happened to pass by Nouilles de Lan Zhou one bitter-cold Friday evening. It was absolutely freezing (-22) and despite not being hungry, we needed a place to quickly warm up so we could continue to our destination. Seeing the fresh noodles being hand made in front of my eyes through the restaurant window, I was pulled in and decided to order a small vegetarian noodle soup to try. It was my first time at such a place and I was not accustomed to the ordering system. Thankfully, the server was extremely friendly and guided me through the ordering process. He explained all the noodle types and thicknesses and confirmed that the broth was vegetarian. As we were eating in, he also brought us each a small cup of hot green tea.

Within 5 minutes my order arrived and I was instantly taken aback by the portion size! The bowl was huge for a small-size and I wasn't even hungry! Still however, I managed to gobble it down and enjoyed it very much with the chilli oil. The flavours were very fresh and the noodles were perfect.

The interior is very basic with cramped seating in a very small space. There is also an escalator leading down to a grocery store which I found very unusual and random. If it was closer, I would probably grab a takeaway as I wasn't too comfortable inside. However, still a great first- time experience - will definitely be back","4 star rating"

I think the taste is just so-so, it is just typical lan zhou noodle soup.
Also, one the of dish we got had a bug. Even though the server exchanged a new one for us, but I started to question the cleanliness of the kitchen.

Table turnover is quick, which is a must for this tiny dining area. We were hungry, so we agreed to share a table with another couple.  It was a bit awkward (they may have been on a date going south?!?) but once the giant bowls of food arrived, that consumed everyone's attention. 

Once you decide what dish you want, you then need to tell them what shape noodle, what size/thickness, and how spicy.  The noodles have a bit of chew to them.  If you are not experienced with chop sticks, I suggest you go with a finer / smaller noodle.  The wide, fat noodles kept slipping out and splashing back into my broth.  No fork or metal spoon in sight, servers were all busy with other customers.  

We wanted to check out the grocery store downstairs, but it closed while we were eating.  The servers never brought a check to the table - just pay on your way out (cash only I believe). The line to enter was even longer when we left.  Not sure when they cut off the line, as the posted closing time was approaching soon.","5 star rating"

Each spoonful enveloped me in a warmth that was like sinking into a hot tub on a frigid day--soul-satisfyingly good.

That they managed to impress my taste buds at the peak of summer speaks only further reiterates that this place has noodle soup down to a science.

I am a flat wide noodles girl; I always have been and always will be, or so I thought. Then, I tried the san xi (size 3, round) noodles at Nouilles de Lan Zhou and everything I thought I loved about flat wide noodles changed. The reason flat, wide ones are great is that there is more surface area to the noodle which usually translates to better texture and more happiness. 

What I've since learned is that the da kuan (extra wide) noodles here are actually a little too flat for me. The chefs are just that good at rolling out the dough into sheets of noodles. As a result, when cooked, they get a smidge too soft and lose that prime QQ (Asian al dente) bite. 

On the other hand, san xi may be round-bodied, but  its thickness is optimal for QQiness!! The reason? What matters is not the amount of surface area, but really the thickest dimension of the noodle's cross section. 

The large bowls of Special Beef noodles here are laden with oodles of their optimally textured noodles and sold at a jaw-droppingly low price of $12. The rest of the magic lies in the light and clean broth, the thin cuts of beef with just the right amount of fat to keep them tender and the finishing touches of fresh cilantro and chili oil. They've also got more of their addicting chili oil at the table. 

This is the power of Nouilles de Lan Zhou--the ingredients are simple, but when packaged together, yield a bowl I could happily devour any day. Stop in the next chance you get. Your soul will thank you.","5 star rating"

The highlights of the bowl was the noodles, radish slices and tender melt-in-your-mouth beef tendons. 

Service & atmosphere: Seating is slightly cramped but that just adds authenticity to the shop. The entrance of an underground asian market is housed inside the restaurant so after you are full from your noodles, you Jocan walk it off in the market.

During the 2018 summer heatwave, my girlfriend and I were craving some serious hand pulled noodles.  The restaurant is cramped, and the table arrangements appear random.  The food is amazing.  After the customers receive their food they become absolutely fixated on consumption, despite the fact that the place was boiling and everyone was inhaling hot soup!

The Dan Dan Noodles are spicy, and I was uncertain whether my sweat was a consequence of the weather or the noodles, but I didn't really care.   Their noodles are satisfying.   

I don't know who would complain about the food at this restaurant except for the unique connoisseurs of Panda Express and Manchu Wok.   Nouilles De Lan Zhou place is amazing, and we will return. 

A 4 star was provided only because of the dense seating arrangement.  I would also consider this restaurant 5 stars based upon the food.","4 star rating"

We got there at a lucky time because when we arrived there was only 1 party ahead of us! While we waited for our table the line grew and was out the door by the time our table was ready. There were 4 of us (2 adults, 2 kids) and there are only a few tables in the restaurant. We only waited about 10 mins which wasn't bad. They turn tables really quickly. Small, limited menu so the food comes out super fast. You can watch them pulling the noodles in the front window.

They have freshly pulled noodles which they pull at the front of their restaurant if you're looking for a little show before your meal. I've only ever tried their lan zhou pulled noodle which you can get in a couple of different sizes (small med large or xl) and you can choose to get a spicy broth (which is the same broth they use for the non spicy but they add some chili oil). Comes with a few slices of thinly sliced beef, coriander, and turnip. The broth is very tasty and the noodles are also quite good. I have also tried their spicy cucumber salad which is topped with crushed peanuts (so avoid if you have allergies!) I am giving this place only 4 stars because it is quite small so once all the seats are filled you have to wait outside (or get it to go). Also the quality of the cucumber salad has its good days and days where its just ok. But the pulled noodle soup is great so that is worth trying here!","4 star rating"

I love how you can see the fresh hand pulled noodles being made while you're waiting. 
The food? Sooo yummy! Loved my veggie noodle soup, the only thing I would change is to not add the seaweed salad. The noodles themselves were very good.
My fiancé had lots to say about his spicy beef noodle soup. He said multiple times how ""amazing"" it was. And that he would rate 5/5. The next day I flew home and he went back to this restaurant alone to get the same thing because he loved it that much and said he will come back every time he comes back to Montreal.","5 star rating"

Anyways, the noodles were delicious! Hand made, hand pulled noodles are the softest noodles you will ever get!

This places makes me feel at home. Authentic pulled noodle with a rich deep beef broth. I crave this all the time, it's especially delicious in the cold fall and winter. 

The major draw as you're walking passed is seeing the noodles getting pulled. You can choose the size and shape of your noodle, whatever suits your palette. 

I usually get the large round noodles. There are also combos that come with a small salad - spicy cucumber (super good and fresh), potato and seaweed (not as good as cucumber, but still nice) and there's a last one I can't recall. They also have cured beef plates, which remind me of home. If you run out of noodles, you can ask for more for a small price! 

There's usually a line so be prepared for that, but it's well worth the wait! Service is also pretty fast. I like to get a big bowl of noodles and bring it home for lunch over a few days. 

In my opinion, this place is better than Nudo and certainly feels more authentic!","5 star rating"

Personally I think it's an average Lan Zhou noodle place, I don't get the hype. Yes, portions are big, don't get medium unless you are STARVING. But the flavors were lacking, and the noodle was a little overcooked. I've had plenty of better Lan Zhou noodles in Manhattan. I guess this is what lack of competition does to a market.

They make their broth with star anise and I think a little bit of cinnamon. It's like Pho- but much much stronger.

- HUGE portions. I didn't believe it when people said that the portions are huge. ""how huge could it be?"" HUGE!!! I was starving and I only ate half of my medium bowl. 
- Flavours on point. The broth is packed with flavour 
- Customizable noodles. They have multiple types of noodles, so you can choose shape and thickness 
- Noodle texture. Wonderful. 
- So many toppings. They are not cheap with the meat/veggies at all. So so so much! 
- Super cheap prices. Around 30$ after tax and tip for two. 

Cons: 
- 45min wait at 1pm on Saturday 
- Cramped places. We had to share a table with another group of two 
- Lemon water didn't taste like lemon. It just tasted like water, but there were little bits of stuff floating in it and at first I thought it was just dirty, but when I saw everyone had those, I understood that it's flavourless lemon bits.

The noodles are fresh made right before your eyes, where the dough is pulled to the right size depending on the order. The noodle texture is perfect, fresh and chewy with the right kind of bounce. Both the classic soup noddles and the zhajiang noodles were delicioussss. Their egg is great too so if your order doesn't come with one, might as well get one for extra. 
The food is a great deal! They give you large portions, even if you choose a small bowl size. I like to take the rest home cause the leftovers make another meal TBH. Theres also some combos that include a side and egg as well. Also, ask for their free tea! It's really mild with Chinese dates and flowers.

Ya, I can tell you that I can a giant vat of noodles in a soup with beef, that they were the longest hand-stretched noodles you can imagine, and that if you add the chili oil and other things you get this alchemy of salty, vinegary, spicy in your mouth. But you just can't encapsulate the magic of it unless you go.

Starting from the outside, you know it's going to be good. There's a line out the door, and this is in the heat of the summer when you know that during soup season (the cold months) you're going to have a much longer line. Inside the seating is sparse and the chairs/tables tiny. And then there's the escalator. In the middle of this already tiny space is an escalator that comes up from the Asian market below. Like... this is an exit for the market. You sit there eating your food watching people come and go from the market, walking through the restaurant and out through the front doors. What wacky magic is this? Just know that if it is winter, the doors will always be open and it will, I imagine, never warm up inside.

We were tearing through Chinatown and this was the last stop. One massive bowl to share between three of us. The large size was indeed hot tub sized and we all three shared the bowl and had leftovers (though we arrived somewhat full). The noodles don't come out easily and I was introduced to a method of cutting them by leaning in and gnawing off the middle, right at the bowl's rim. Judging by the looks we got from fellow diners, I'd say that is not a typical, accepted practice.

It was really wonderful and one of the best memories of my recent trip. I was in such good company with colleagues and family, in a beautiful city, eating handmade food from passionate people, enjoying an experience and feelings of warm soupy happiness that I want to take with me wherever I go.","5 star rating"

You can see the kitchen from the dining area and the kitchen also faces the street so you can watch them work from the outside. Noodles are hand drawn, made to order which is always delightful to watch!  

The place is cozy and right above an Asian supermarket so it's not immediately apparent. But it's definitely worth the wait and the price is most certainly right!

It cost around 12$(taxes and tips included).
The noodle is chewy and the soup base is delicious. The beef slices are also well marinated and it has the perfect proportion of tendon and meat.

I also like their cold dishes. The edamame is my favorite and if I am hungry enough I would ask for an extra egg.

This small restaurant is always crowded. The seating is not very comfortable. 
I always order a combo which include a noodle soup, a salad and a tea-infused egg. The various sickness of the noodle really makes the noodle so different from another. I always ask for chilli oil.

The door to the restaurant is constantly being opened and closed due the fact that the store shares the same entryway with the restaurant...If you sit on one of the 3 seats right by the door your food will get cold before you finish it.

The thick pork sauce had the right amount of ground pork and not making it a watery texture (everyone knows what I mean when restaurants put less pork and jack up the watery texture so it's more cost effective. All the peanuts and spices complemented the noodles and sauce and brought up the savory dish. Not too salty either which makes me want to eat it more.

I usually never finish my food and give it to my bf to finish but it was amazing. We are here on Vacation and coming back tomorrow for another tasting during lunch. Restaurant has a small menu but only because they know what's best to serve and focus on their specialties to give you the best.  

Beef noodle Soup was amazing too as we had a medium and medium size flat noodles (nice and chewy). Big chunks of tender meat and you are able to customize your Spiciness level.

Considering the cold weather that has just set upon us, nothing better than a good soup to warm our hearts. Went there on a cold Saturday for dinner with friends. I arrived a little after my friends were already. When arrive, there was a line already. To consider, this restaurant has very limited seating spots as it is located right above a grocery store. Lines are to be expected at any time of the day due to that. 

The menu itself offers very small variety, which can be good or bad. In this case, it is definitely a good thing since they have perfected their menu to those limited items. You can also decide which kinds of noodles (size and shape) you want. Worth mentioning is their weekend special which my friends praise a lot. Unfortunately, as a non-spicy eater, I was not able to taste it. I have opted for the original noodle bowl. It came to 12$ for a large bowl, before taxes. By large, I mean LARGE.

The restaurant is located above an underground grocery store and it's pretty small in size. It can get very cramped during peak hours. As soon as you walk in, you'll immediately be able to smell the savory homemade broth.

FOOD: Definitely one of my favorite places to go. The soups warms you up no matter what time of the year it is. You can choose the size and width of your noodles which is a cool feature. The noodles are all hand-pulled and you can watch them do so in the window. And of course, the soup is absolutely amazing and it tastes super authentic, I always look forward to coming here. Also, the portions are HUGE.

PRICE: It's very affordable. It's a fantastic price for the food that you're getting.

SERVICE: Staff is very efficient. They bring your meals to you quite quickly.","5 star rating"

This past week, I finally had the time to wait in line (about 15 minutes at 2pm on a Sunday), and test this place out. Upon ordering, I was a bit disappointed because they were out of tea. The food, however, made up for it.

The ""salad"": the cucumber salad had a perfectly balanced, crunchy peanut/Sichuan peppercorn topping. Definitely worth ordering if you choose to get the ""combo""

The noodles: The broth for the vegetarian noodles was better and richer than any vegetarian broth I've had at similar restaurants, and the noodles were just as fresh and springy as I had expected. The egg, on the other hand (which I had been excited for, given some of the reviews I had read), didn't have enough of a ""tea"" taste to it but it was okay, because I don't think I'd want that tea taste in my soup. In the future, I'd be interested to see if they could offer a vegetarian version of the beef noodle soup, because I feel like that would be amazinggg.

We each got one of the noodles except for the chef recommendation because they weren't serving it that day. The noodles came and they were heavenly! The broth was cooked very well and it wasn't too salty or spicy like other noodle houses.

Anyways, the noodles are fantastic! I really liked the da kuan, which was the biggest square noodle. My sister loved the thinnest noodles. We also got the thickest circular noodle, but that was a bit on the chewier side for my tastes.

We got the special beef (not the beef noodle soup served seasonally), Dan Dan, and veggie flavors. Highly recommend the first two, the veggie not so much. It had a strange coconut flavor to it, and while I do like coconut, I wasn't feeling it in this soup.

As long as you don't get the veggie, the food is great and the service is fast. I can't imagine what the wait would be during normal hours though. Also, the portion sizes are huge.

The noodles are really chewy, actually have a bounce when biting into it. The kids love it. The beef tendons are pretty good too.

We got the cucumber salad for appetizer. I really like the peanut crumbles sprinkled on top. The cucumber tasted refreshing and spicy, it reminded me of cucumber kimchi. They use a lot of the Szechuan peppers so it's a bit numbing.

We ordered the noodles with braised beef tendon and Zhajiang. I especially liked the Zhajiang, which was cold noodles. I really liked the black bean sauce and the tea egg was as good as usual. I think I would've wanted more of the sauce compared to the noodle portion they gave us.
The braised beef tendon was super tender and soup was heart-warming. 

It's cool that you can choose the size of your noodles here, from round thin noodles to thick flat noodles. I always go with the thinnest round ones, I found they have the best chewy texture.

The restaurant is pretty small with about 10 tables and a long table against the wall w/ stools and a few seats in front of their kitchen.  The restroom is on the 5th floor of the building that you have to access w/ a service elevator.

We ordered:

Julienned squash & seaweed salad - refreshingly perfect! The sweet, salty, and acidity levels were all in perfect harmony.

Cucumber appetizer - the cucumbers were coated in a creamy, porky, and spicy sauce. It had a nice amount of heat and very tasty.

Cold beef w/ chili oil - served w/ scallions, 1 broccoli and 1 cauliflower, and sate chili oil. The chili oil was packed w/ flavor and had a slight delicious garlic flavor.  This definitely elevated the dish.  This beef is the same beef they use in the noodle soup dish.

Beef noodle soup (Large) - WOW, this bowl was HUGE! Luckily hubby and I shared this bowl.  The noodles, meat, broth, and chili were all PERFECTION. We added an egg to this dish for an extra $1. The egg was full of flavor and hubby enjoyed it very much.  There was also daikon in the bowl, but I didn't eat it.  Wish it came with some greens, but that's okay b/c we had 2 veggie sides to eat along with the noodle soup.  

Our lunch was so good that we came back and ordered the zhajiang mian and the julienned squash & seaweed salad togo for dinner. 

Zhajiang mian - huge portion served w/ broth on the side.  The pork and fermented black bean sauce was delicious.  This bowl had julienned carrots, bok choy, edamame, and pieces of pickled mustard greens.  It was definitely tricky tossing the noodles when we got back to our hotel b/c the noodles had congealed together.  A few minutes in the microwave loosened up the noodles which solved the issue.

Overall, we would definitely return to this restaurant if we visit Montreal again.  Delicious food, fast service, and very affordable/cheap prices!","5 star rating"

This place is always busy and crowded so my part of 2 had to share a table but we did not care. We drank the delicious tea they served us and merrily ate our dishes and left with a full warm belly. 

Only thing is the service is a little mehhhh but I could look past that.","5 star rating"

Service was super fast and our noodles arrived almost as fast as we ordered it. Noodles come in different sizes and shapes and are all hand made at the restaurant. We ordered the flat noodles and were not disappointed. I preferred the smaller size flat noodles as I found the largest too chewy. The broth is simple but still very flavourful. We also ordered a couple side dishes of spicy beef and some spicy cucumbers. Both were very tasty and had a very mild heat.

I love how you can choose the thickness of the noodles and see how fresh it is made. The noodles are perfectly al dente and are honestly, possibly the best noodles I've had. The noodles with the soup though? Not sure. The vegetarian soup was honestly alright. It had this interesting coconuty taste and I literally had to dump half of the bowl of chilli to make it spicy. It was good but not incredible. It hit the spot at the time but it wasn't the best of noodles I've ever had.

Perfect for chilly weather with generous portions on soup and noodles. I don't think they add any MSG since I left the restaurant stuffed and thankfully not dehydrated. Make sure to eat the thicker noodles quick because they will get soggy if you don't slurp em up fast enough. 

I got the small combo which comes with a small side dish. I tried the pickled edamame which was a little too street market tasting for me and the cucumbers which were pretty spicy! The pickled edamame went perfect with the soup, however, so I highly recommend dumping some in your noodle soup for added flavor.

Located in the Chinatown district of Montreal, locals & tourists alike are often seen lining up to get a taste of this new craze, since the place is very small & only a few tables are available; depending on the time of day, expect no less than 30 minute wait time. While awaiting, diners can enjoy the art of noodle hand pulling that dates back hundreds, if not thousands, of years, the chefs cook the noodles right in front of diners & mere spectators, so get your iPhone & S8+ ready to blog about the experience.

And if you're lucky enough to get a table, table sharing may be necessary if alone, the noodles cone in a HUMONGOUS size of soup bowl, the appearance looks enticing. When ordering, I had asked for ""大辣"" - I.e, Big Spicy, however, it wasn't hot at all. The noodle soup with beef tendons looked delicious, but the broth lacked the punch, especially considering the craze it has drawn. I thought the meats, combination of beef shank slices & tendons tasted better than the rest, again expectations were high due to its popularity seen by the daily long lines & social media reviews, so my experience was good, but not blown away, hence no 5 stars.

For those considering trying it, I'd do once just to get it off your culinary bucket list, but I wouldn't wait in line for more than half-an-hour. In Montreal, there are other better options such as Vietnamese Pho noodle soup, Schwartz' Montreal Smoked Meats, etc","4 star rating"

I only get their signature noodles with the second third noodles (er xi - I find them to have the best texture, nice and chewy but also soft). The broth is nice and flavourful, not quite as good as the real thing but close enough. The only thing that I find lacking is the spicy oil, back n Lanzhou, the bowl is covered with half a cm thick of spicy oil while here I had to nearly empty the pot on the table to achieve a something close.

For lunch, there is a line that extends way onto the sidewalk, but it seems to be shorter at night.  The place is really popular, with the noodle pulling show drawing a lot of interest.  The place is small and has only a few tables and chairs.  Don't expect luxurious settings, but rather look forward to an authentic Chinese noodle house experience.  It's cramped, busy and noisy!  I think it all made the meal something way more than a time to eat.  It was fun knowing the noodles were pulled just a few meters away from you, even exciting.  Imagine, it is really made from scratch!

i had the noodles with meat sauce combo.  You need to tell them how spicy it should be and how thick the noodles should be.  Light bulb: the guy pulling the noodles was making them in so many different ways!  Flat, fat, thin.  The meat sauce was awesome but the noodles were an experience.  What can I say?  It just had a texture and consistency that I don't remember ever tasted before.  It was like a wonderful kind of spaghetti bolognese, except Chinese.  Any child would love it.  

Unfortunately, I didn't try the other dishes, so I personally cannot comment on them.  Particularly, I am curious on how the broth tastes like.  My friend, along with the other people sitting beside me along the same long table, seemed to enjoy their broths and noodles.  I certainly could try the other dishes when I get the chance to go back, if only I didn't want to eat the noodles with meat sauce again.

We ordered Dan Dan and special lan zhou noodles, both small size - decent for one. As guidance: I'd say their medium size bowl would fill up two, and large would fill family of three.

The noodles are the star of the show - springy but not hard, far from soft, tasty. Nothing like I ever tasted in my whole life.

Dan Dan noodle was nicely seasoned, excellent balance of meat quantity and cilantro. The meat sticks as you mix the ingredients together. Simply 10 out of 10.

Soup was tasty, rightly seasoned, perfectly spicy... and doesn't leave tingly feeling at the end like other msg enduced instant noodle. Not inferring a comparison, just giving a clear picture. In short - exceptional.

From there, you'll be asked about the size of noodle and if you want the noodle round or rectangle and the spice level. 

I got the size medium (for $9.99) with an XL size round noodle and it was HUGE. I ended up only getting a medium spice level and I totally could have added more spiciness. The price is extremely cheap for what it is and very good. I am so happy that I got to experience super authentic noodles.

Aside from the fresh noodles, the experience, and the broth; the meats were a total disappointment.

There are three main soup types, beef, chicken and pork all served with hand pulled Lan-Zhou noodles, the most popular is the beef and for good reason it's fabulous with a very rich spicy beefy broth.There are three soup sizes small, medium and large, the two larger sizes can be easily shared as they are hugh; the spiciness of your dish can be selected as well. This is a tiny space seating no more than 20 people at most and gets very crowded quickly but the line seems to move fairly well. This is a great stop for lunch and then a visit downstairs to the market to pick up some of your favorite items. This should be on your list of stops when visiting Montreal.","4 star rating"

Tasting is believing, and I honestly don't think this place deserves any more than 2 stars. Reasons:

1) The place is located in a corner section above a supermarket. Seating is extremely limited, like less than 40, and if you have a party of less than 4, you're likely to be seated with strangers in the same table. The wait can be atrocious. 

2) The noodle: while it was made in front of me, I found it to be undercooked and not the true Lanzhou ""chewy"". It's OK, but seriously you can get better noodles in the supermarket below. 

3) The soup stock: tasteless and salty, like someone took tap water, added beef stock and salt, and called it a day. 

4) The beef: it was...okay. 

The Lanzhou beef noodle place in Philly is way better, but driving 7 hours south is probably not in most people's interest for Lanzhou beef noodles.","2 star rating"

Serves one of the best beef noodle soups in all of Montreal! 

They're not stingy with the beef! The beef chunks are tender but soo flavorful. The beef flavor is incredibly rich and savory, and it's not too oily. This is the true star of the restaurant!

You have a choice of size for noodles - we chose thick. Noodles were plentiful AND FLAVORFUL !

**Advice:
*portions are very large!*
*If you have a high spicy/heat tolerance then the spicy sauce on the table will be weak for you. Ask for the legit hot hot sauce from the kitchen. 1 drop will burn your mouth!***  
*Order the Beef Noodle soup*

We also ordered the Vegetable soup . Very light in flavor but would not order again.

FIVE STARS. We came here mid-afternoon, around 2:00 PM on a Tuesday after a horrible dining experience our first night in Chinatown Montreal the evening before. 

This place is comfy, hip -- wooden tables and chairs. A bit smaller for a noodle joint, but still very homey and ""cozy"", especially when it's 20 degrees F outside. There's a window in front of the restaurant where you can see the noodles being handmade from scratch from the outside. They make fresh noodles for each bowl ordered. It was very interesting to see how the dough was rolled, cut, simmered in broth -- all by hand. Note that there is a big stairwell to an underground supermarket in the middle of the store. Although some may say it takes away from the ambience, it didn't bother us too much! 

The service - pretty above average. We were seated quickly, given hot tea and a pitcher of lemon water, and had our order taken right when we came in. Noted that it was a slow mid-week afternoon, so perhaps Friday and weekend nights are a bit more difficult to be seated in such a timely manner. Our order came out in about 15 minutes.

The food - EXCELLENT. There's only 3 options of which soup to order on their menu: a vegetarian option, a pork soup, and a beef soup. I ordered the beef soup -- their most popular one. They had 3 sizes: Small ($7.99), Medium ($9.99), and Large ($11.99). I ordered a Medium. They also give you the option of spicy or non-spicy. I had spicy.

The portions are HUGE. My medium bowl came out to be about 11""-12"" in diameter. Lots and lots of noodles, broth was seasoned with spices and pepper, a handful of beef, steaming hot. The spoon they also give you is also very interesting (think stew soup instead of typical Asian soup spoon), and it was a GREAT meal. I was full afterward, and for the affordable price for such a large serving size -- I will definitely come here again and again next time in Montreal. 

Final notes - The broth was flavorful, the noodles were very fresh, and the beef was great. I was extremely impressed by the efficiency of the service and, of course, the portions for the price. Five stars for a great, simple, and authentic dining experience. 

Helpful tips - if you have a large appetite for meat, they offer ""extra"" beef (or any meat that comes with the soup you order) and ""extra"" noodles for an additional $2-3. My normal Medium bowl was more than enough for me, so it wasn't an issue at all! Furthermore, the ""spicy"" option is not too hot, for those who prefer a ""no sweat"" spice kick.

If you come to Chinatown Montreal, I really recommend dropping by this place by all means. I wish they would open one of these in the States, as I can see myself grabbing a handful of friends every weekend for lunch AND dinner. Hot, fast, and fresh. 5/5!!!","5 star rating"

Love getting a free show of the noodle master in the window. They have 6 shapes and sizes from sliver thin to inch thick, best part is the noodles are made rolled and stretched on the spot. 

The broth, vegetarian and non are both delicious. Wish they had more tables and side dishes!

The service is straight forward and pretty standard. Its rly warm in the restaurant. 

Each table has its own tray of chili oil, vinegar and sauces.

First, it's the very definition of tiny hole in the wall. You sit elbow to elbow next to other people slurping up some of the best soup to be had in Montreal like happy little pigs at the trough.
They sit you down on a tiny rickety wood table perched above an escalator leading down to the grocery story below. There's no place to put your winter coat or bag so you sorta stay fully dressed but it's fine cause it's so good you don't talk, you just eat fast. They serve you up this horrible tea (to be fair, I'm not a tea person, I usually only get chamomile). The tea, 'cleanses the palate' by erasing all memories of good tasting food, and starts you off low so the soup tastes like the best thing you've ever had.
I ordered the dan dan bowl with the fattest noodles BOTH TIMES (you can choose the noodle size). The noodles were doughy and perfect. 
Then, when they bring it out, it comes in this bowl larger than your head, slippery plastic chop sticks and a small ladle to eat/drink/slurp it with. It's nearly impossible to pick up the noodles and then keep them on the chopsticks long enough to funnel them into your mouth - a humbling challenge to say the least.
Oh but the food is so good it's worth the abuse of the crammed seating, cold winter air coming in every time the door opens, and inadequate eating utensils. Highly recommend.","5 star rating"

I had the beef with noodles (medium bowl is huge). The broth and noodles were good, I thought the meat was way overcooked and dry. Nothing special to eat at all.

My wife had the noodles with vegetables. This is a better dish. The noodles were ""eggier"" and thin. The Broccoli was great.

I also had the spicy cucumber salad. VERY GOOD! Not super spicy so go for it!

It's usually a small joint with tiny tables and even tinier chairs. There's rarely air conditioning, and a fan is typically blowing from a corner of the dining room. Noodles MUST be fresh and handmade, if not by the owners of the restaurant, then by a noodle factory. The ""mouthfeel"" of the noodles is very important - something not unrelated from the term ""al dente"" in Italian cuisine. The rest of the dish tend to vary (broth, toppings, seasoning). 

Nouilles de Lan Zhou used to only serve beef noodles, in three different bowl size, and different types of noodles (round or flat). They have since expanded their menu (e.g. cold noodles, beef tendon noodles) and added a few side dishes (e.g. edamame and pickled mustard green, spicy cucumbers). The regular beef noodles remain my favorite.

The restaurant is located in a weirdly arranged space at the entrace of the G&D supermarket, and has probably less than 30 seats. Service is fast, and the illustrated menu is helpful to make a choice. It usually goes like this: 1) choice of noodles, and if required, 2) bowl size, 3) type of noodle, and 4) spicy or not. Some noodles, such as the beef tendon noodle, only has one size (medium). Talking about size, the portions are humooongous. I don't recommend ordering anything larger than medium if you can't finish, e.g. three Big Macs.

It's okay. It's worth it.

Everyone is there for the same reason - to eat those bowls of steamy soup, made with hand pulled noodles.

Before you enter, you get an inkling of the goodness to come - the guy in the window is painstakingly and expertly working a hunk of dough into thin strands of fresh soup noodles. Over and over.

There are only a few items to order. Get the Lanzhou special soup.

A medium is plenty for most and probably more than enough for some.

Highlights: The noodles are excellent.  They're soft with good texture.  I ordered the zhajiangmian, which is a large bowl of noodles with pork in a ground bean sauce topped with a layer of vegetables.  You get plenty of food in your order - in addition to your noodle bowl, you'll get a large cup of broth on the side.  The vegetables were very fresh and there was a lot of variety.  I noticed a pleasant herbal taste to the broth - definitely was a good thing to have on the side.  My photo shows a lot of vegetables, but they're not cheap with either the meat or the noodles underneath.

Critiques: Cash and debit only, but this is typical practice for a lot of the best Chinese restaurants.  Luckily, I had exchanged a few USD for some CAD at the overpriced exchange kiosk at the airport. With respect to the dish, the pork was saltier than what I'm accustomed to for this dish.  If the dish were less salty, I'd be giving this five stars.

Overall: Excellent quantity and top notch noodles are served at Nouilles de Lan Zhou.  I'd go back to try the same noodles with other toppings (for example, a beef tendon noodle dish that is only served on the weekends).","4 star rating"

The seating was really awkward. My boyfriend and I had to share with another couple... and that really lessened the experience. We couldn't hold a conversation comfortably because they were sitting at the same table with us.

In a small kitchen with a window facing the street, the cooks made fresh noodles (to the width ordered- narrow to very wide), cooked noodles, added sides and broth. It is an amazing production. We had the cucumber and seaweed salad, which tasted fresh and nicely pickled. We had the cold marinated sliced beef with scallions, hot pepper sauce, and peanuts. This was a nice addition to our beef noodle soup. I got the wide noodles, which went well with the excellent broth, scallions, and beef.

There's a large bowl with my name on it. I may not be able to finish it but you bet your elastic waisted pants, I will give it my all.

Stick with their specialty - the Beef Noodle Soup - with its wonderfully tender beef and deliciously chewy noodles. And you get to choose your noodle shape/size - what fun! The broth was flavorful with a touch of chili oil to give it a little more oomph. Bring tissues for that runny nose. I got a small bowl, which was plenty filling with its generous portions. While b.'s Vegetable Noodle Soup was decent, the odd topping of seaweed salad in the soup turned the broth an unappetizing green color halfway through.

$6.99 for a small, $8.99 for a medium, and $10.99 for a large.

Seating is crowded so you may end up sharing a table with strangers. There was no A/C when we went and it was a fairly warm day so you may end up sharing a table with sweaty strangers. b. noted that the bowls may or may not be entirely sanitized as the woman seemed to be only rinsing them off with pressurized (hopefully hot) water, so don't go licking them clean. The restaurant itself is awkwardly situated above a supermarket with stairs and an escalator right smack dab in the middle. This is a plus for the occasional air-conditioned breeze from below if you're seated by the railing, for people watching, and for grabbing dessert afterwards - Pocky!","4 star rating"

But the tenderness of the soup, and the essence of noodles are both missing at this place.

location: in chinatown, adjacent to a market, this place is always compared with the other place, which sserves the same kind of noodles. the seats are fairly limited, that is to say that you have to wait in line until someone finished their food and then you can grab your seats and eat.

Food: they have three sizes of noodles. Small, medium and large. And you can choose the size of the noodles, and the thickness. In addition, you can choose how spicy you want the soup to be. I had medium, size 2 and less spicy for lunch. The portion is huge. I barely could finish it but I saw many men were eating large size. My ""OMG"" face is clearly showing towards them. I found the soup bit salty and I wished that I could add more spice into my soup to alleviate some saltiness. The noodle is less tendered and made me even miss more about China. I wanted to eat the real, autentihc one.

Price: small for 7? Medium for 10. Very pricy with regard to their qualities and limited other choices for lunch, and service quality. 

Overall: although I probably won't be back in a while, I still do not recommend to come to this place. Why? It's just not worth to spend 10 dollars to eat something that is not that delicious. I 'd rather spend the same amount of money on Ramen than this.","3 star rating"

I recommend the place as it is one of the better hand pulled noodle I have had outside of Asia
-I usually get the Spicy Beef noodle Combo which includes a salad and tea egg. I recommend getting the medium for $12.97 CAD (before tax) and going with the spicy cucumber salad
-the noodles are fresh (high volumes at this restaurant) and beef is tender. The broth is flavorful. I usually skip drinking the broth (too much sodium) but couldn't help myself from taking a few sips. The waiter does ask you how spicy you want your noodles so don't be shy if you can't handle spicy
-the spicy cucumber salad is okay but I think it is superior vs the other 2 choices
-I wish they would give you the tea egg separately vs dropping it in the broth
-the restaurant provides free tea or water
-oddly shaped restaurant, L-shaped because it is basically on top of the large supermarket which is downstairs

TASTE :
This Beef Noodle Soup is different from Japanese Ramen. This is more light & spicy I would say. If you like Asian noodles, you'd better try it to enlarge your taste. It worth it.

I never tried Chinese noodle in China so I don't know the original taste of Chinese Ramen but this is one of the most delicious Ramen in Montreal. Much better than other Japanese Ramens with fake tacky instant taste.

ORDER TIP :
You can choose the shape of noodle(5~6) & it varies final outcome. You can also choose it to be spicy or not.

MSG soup! Maybe it's my hyper sensitivity to MSG, but I was thirsty for at least two hours after having their signature beef noodles. 

I ordered the thick noodles. Noodles were a bit undercooked and lacked elastic texture that you'd expect from handmade Chinese noodles. The beef was a bit dry.

You have your choice of noodle type and thickness. I got the vegetable soup and added beef to it. The noodles had the right amount of chew and firmness. And unlike many noodles, they didn't absorb the soup at all. They had their own distinct flavor and added to the dish.

Like the menu, I was let down. Basically, there's a variety of noodle shapes and sizes available and the noodles I received were two times bigger than the ones depicted in the menu. Not only that but my noodles were definitely undercooked. My broth was average with the oil making most of the flavor but I got to admit that the beef was tender and packed with beefy goodness. Unfortunately, 2 out of the 3 entrees that I tried had unpleasant combinations of flavors that still haunt me to this day.

When I went in, I felt like I was back to the old chinatown ( but cleaner) that I used to grow up in. The kitchen staff told me to pick a seat. I took a seat next to the stairway down  the grocery store and the waitress gave me a menu. While I was looking at the menu, a waiter came in to take my order, I took the one with the beef noodle soup with no spice and a seaweed salads. Initially, I wanted a medium bowl but he reassured me that a small is enough for me. Then, he went to give my orders to the kitchen staff. 

After 3 minutes of waiting, my seaweed salads came, I took one bite at the seaweed and I was blown away. It has the right texture and the right sweetness in it. Next, my noodle order came and I took a bite and I was pleasantly surprise of the freshness of the noodles and the broth is not overwhelming that I literally wanted to drink the whole thing. The beef was the right quantity too, I can't complain. 

Overall, the place is well decorated, the staffs care about their customers and the food lives up to the hype. It's great that the menu options are limited because I wouldn't know which one I want to order (they all look so good!). I will come back in the future.

Seriously, get the small if you have a size choice unless you want leftovers for the next day. I had the beef tendon noodle soup, which only comes in medium and certainly served as my lunch and dinner that day. The tendon was cooked well and not too chewy. The broth was flavourful and reminded me of the dark Taiwanese beef noodle soup broth. The noodles were perfectly al dente and chewy, as advertised by the guy kneading away by the window. 

My boyfriend got the dandan noodles. While this dish was very delicious, it's also extremely oily! Beware, if you have a sensitive stomach. In addition, they use copious amounts of peppercorn so be prepared for that numbing-spicy feeling in your mouth. 

All in all, a pleasant, efficient meal for a great price. Also, don't expect a Micheline 3-star restaurant service; Asian countries have a different mentality towards service.

Had the standard beef noodles. Broth was pretty weak by Chinese standards, which I felt condemned the dish for me. Noodles and meat cooked ok but certain bits of the noodles were not pulled properly and ended up being clumped together.

If you're going to get the traditional soup, it basically just choosing your thickness of noodle and then whether you want spicy or not!

I don't think that getting a large is worth the extra two dollars... I think I definitely would have been satisfied with the medium. I didn't have the thinnest noodle option, but my friend did and those were my favorite.

They also offer a customer's choice for noodle type/thickness.  My personal favorite is the ultra-thin noodle, because they're soft and absorb the soup so well.  Though you can also go for big inches-wide chewy flat noodle and anything in between.  

The portion is larger than you'd normally see in Montreal.  Their small is most people's normal size, so get small for solo, or get a medium/large to share.  If you always complain that other places don't give enough, you're going to leave happy from here.  It's worth the wait if the line doesn't go beyond the entrance.  Price, quality, quantity are all on-point.

They let us browse the menus but they did not take our orders until right after 11 am. A very good blend of tea was also served then as well.

Overall, I must say the broth and the noodles were excellent. Very natural beef broth tasting without a lot of salt. Even the side dishes were not bad at all. We tried the house beef noodle in the ""third thin"" size and the dry pork noodles. They let you choose and specify the hand-pulled noodle size from the super thin to super fat depending on your own noodle texture preference. You can even choose the spicy level too.

Even a medium is quite large. Make sure you get their combo to get a side dish, a tea egg, and a beef noodle in a cheaper combo price vs a la carte pricing. Pork noddle unfortunately only comes in one huge size! We had to pack half of it in the end. Will come back again for sure!","4 star rating"

The good news is I've found it. Lan Zhou has the most incredible hand pulled noodles which are slightly chewy and oh so fresh. Their vegetable noodle soup comes in a different broth that they make and tastes incredible. I asked the waiter what the broth is made of and he said it's a secret recipe - how alluring. The coolest part is you can ask for the noodle size you want when you order because they make them to order.

I took one star away cause it was so hot in there you couldn't fully enjoy the food. Makes service really efficient! Had the beef brisket noodle which is one size, and that size is LARGE, I ate as much as I could and it's as if I ate nothing at all, but at least we could take it home.

You could order three different sizes depending on the size of your appetite.  I ordered a medium.  It was so good that I almost ate it all, yet I was amazed that I didn't have that greasy, salty stuffed-up feeling in my stomach that I sometimes get at certain Chinese food restaurants.  

If you drink your broth, you might be okay with the small.  I'm on a low-sodium diet so I tend to avoid drinking the broth.  Also, a side note--someone ordered the vegetarian noodles and was surprised that the broth was a curry based one.  She loved it, though and said it was one of the best broths that she's had.  I'm not sure if she just didn't read the menu well or if it wasn't specifically noted.  

Anyway, the place was packed (try not to take your shopping bags with you because things are cramped here) so I am not the only one thinking that this place is awesome.  I will definitely return to Nouilles de Lan Zhou (so good that I have the name memorized) when visiting Montreal again.  No credit cards.  Prices were reasonable.

the great thing about this place is the ability to chose your noodle size, shape, and spice level. word of advice, go less spicier b/c you can always add more spicy oil. the small is almost like a regular size but plenty of people were wolfing down the medium sized bowl (which was almost as big as their face),

We were guided to a bar facing the wall, then we noticed a caucasian couple (a party of two) who just began eating, sitting in a table clearly for four people.

But for $10 for a bowl of delicious noodles I honestly don't care what the place looks like. If I lived in Montreal I would come here over and over again.","5 star rating"

So here goes my first review.

This is an awesome Chinese place in the Chinatown district in Montreal.  It may seem like a tourist trap that the place has a guy who hand rolls noodles in the front window, but the food (and the guy) is for real.

I went there for lunch with my girlfriend on Valentine's Day (I know, I'm a true romantic). It was freezing outside but the place was still pretty full.  There aren't a lot of seats inside, but diners turn over quick, so getting a spot was not hard.  When I sat down, the servers immediately brought a super hot yet very welcome tea.  I ordered a medium spicy beef tendon noodle, and it was delicious.  The broth was rich and flavorful, and though the beef at times was a little gamey (it's beef tendon, so this should be expected), the rich flavor more than offset the chewy texture. And oh yes, the noodles were fantastic.  

The portions are huge, and I couldn't finish off the entire bowl.  Unless you are really really hungry, a small bowl should meet most appetites just fine.  But if it's any consolation, the medium bowl only cost $10 USD.

Next time I find myself in Montreal on a cold day, I'm coming to this place.","5 star rating"

Ordering is simple, first you choose what size bowl you want. I was famished and went with the large. Be warned, I highly recommend that you stick to the medium because the large size was gigantic. You can also choose what thickness you want your noodles to be.

There are a few appetizer options: spicy cucumber, pickled cabbage, marinated eggs.

I went with the spicy cucumber since it was hot outside and wanted to whet my appetite even more.

It reminded me of my travels in Asia where I would walk into a small noodle shack and sit down at the bar and watch the chef make the food in front of me.

The broth is clear - with the right balance - not too salty or bland. The noodles are fresh and chewy. The meat is moist when you mix it in the broth.

The food is just alright, the broth isn't too oily or watery but it doesn't have a lot of taste either. Similarly, the noodles are thicker than need be and don't have a particularly satisfying texture I often find in dishes with thick noodles (I.e. Hokkien mee). The price doesn't reflect what you can really get around this area, and the eating space is small and cramped, which seems cute and makes it seem busy and bustling until you're there on a rainy or snowy day and you're moving aside constantly to make space for people in wet coats passing you by all the time.

I've been to many countries and tried different food but this place cannot be beat! When I ordered, I had a chili paste next to me ready to mix to creat my own cuz let's be real, most places their noodles are either salty or too blend. One bite from their soup.. EVERYTHING is perfectly blend. The shop is really small but who cares when the food is delicious. Their noodle bowl are Huge. If u order a large and finishes it, consider your self a professional foodie. Best food place in Chinatown. It's a must eat place.

Will try a different hand-pulled noodle establishment next time.","3 star rating"

Which is why I gave this place a 4 star, because the noodle soup was imo amazing, the portion was big despite the fact that I ordered a small. The service is extremely fast, you'll get your food in no time. 

But the place is tiny and it reflects on the service a lot, it doesn't bother me but I imagine it could bother some people and is important to anyone who plans on coming here. This really isn't a regular restaurant, it's food first, everything else second. It's more like a food stall with seats; you eat, you pay, you leave. I think there's like 2 tables that seats 4 people, sometimes you end up being seated right next to strangers. So if you're expecting a nice comfortable restaurant, you're looking at the wrong place. They do have a take out option.

I also noticed most of the people that were eating there would leave as soon as they were done, so this kind of ""restaurant"" is normal to the regulars.","4 star rating"

Really great texture; you can just feel the hand-made dedication with each bite. The soup may look bland, but it's actually very flavorful, thanks to the Chinese parsley, spring onions, daicon and chili oil. I asked for medium spicy, and it was just right, though beads of sweat were literally forming on my face as I slurped each bite -- but I didn't care, because it was sooo delicious! 

The beef comprised decent cuts of brisket, though nothing fancy. Portion sizes are very generous. I initially wanted to order a medium bowl of noodles as a set (which comes with an egg and a side dish of veggies), but the waiter told me that the medium bowl itself was enough to get me full, so I just went with noodles only.

They were nice enough to let us use credit card (we were out of cash at the end of our trip), but normally only cash or debit so heads up there.

We got to sit at the little bar and watch the kitchen in action. Was really interesting!","5 star rating"

This is definitely not the real deal, but the lack of authenticity aside (I don't judge food by its authenticity; I grew up with and love General Tao and Butter Chicken).

The noodles are not very good. They are hand-made for sure, but so are the noodles from Nudo 2 minutes away, Yuki Lamen (sp?) at Concordia's Faubourg and that one Lamen shop at Eaton Center's food court, and frankly, it's not very good or fresh here.

The seating is atrocious here. It's very cramped, since it's a semi-open area to the outside, flies is a problem in summer and the extreme coldness is a problem in winter. Plus the floor  are just disgusting. The tables aren't very clean either, you'll most likely get your winter jacket and/or shirt dirtied.

The soup stock is itself is very watered down and tasted mainly... I dunno how to describe the flavor that only chemically constituted beef bouillon cube can provide. You might make better beef stock with half chemical flavoring and half real meat and/or bone at home.

TL;DR:
Meh noodle, bad soup, extremely back setting. Good proximity to the metro, much better options, including other Lan Zhou style Lamen, to be had within 3 minutes walking distance.","2 star rating"

The handpulled noodles are incredible and perfect every time. You get options from thin, medium, or thick for round or flat. I love handpulled flat noodles and this is the only place that does them well. Don't get the thick flat noodles though. They end up being ridiculously large and impossible to eat. The broth is always hot and flavourful, full of herbs and seasonings (but the light kind of beef broth, not the heavy dark kind) and the beef is yummy and well-marinated. The small is a slightly large portion of food for the average person. The medium is a very large portion of food that will be more than enough for almost everyone. The large is a bowl as larger as most salad mixing bowls and essentially comes with a little shovel instead of a spoon. If you're not a person who finishes the soup its more manageable, but still. Always add the tea egg, no question. The appetizer/side dishes are good but not worth it cost wise, plus you won't need the additional food. 

I always end up spending around $10 here. Don't bother coming if you're vegetarian. The vegetables they use are frozen and of poor quality and the broth is not comparable to the regular.","5 star rating"

As other reviewers have stated the go to dish here is the Lan Zhou Noodles. There are a variety of sizes to the noodles and they are hand made. I opted for the third thinnest variety as I'm not a big fan of huge knife cut noodles. The noodles came out ok looks wise to my liking, but I was not impressed with the flavor at all. I felt like the noodles were the type that could grow exponentially in hot soup and I felt that they did grow a bit as I ate on. The soup itself was a clearer beef broth which is different from what I was used to. There is an essence of the bone there, but it's not really flavorful at all - pretty watered down in my opinion. As for the beef - it's a couple of thin slivers with no pieces of shank or stew to be substantial. I got the combo that came with the third veggie option which turned out to be a cold seaweed salad which was overly salty. I would say don't believe the hype and skip this place. It's not worth the calories.","2 star rating"

Catherine.  The rest of the review is the same.  

Very inexpensive but very good HANDMADE NOODLES.  There are offered without soup mixed with some sort of sauce.  

We had: 
1.  RED COOKED BEEF SHANK:  This is a very traditional dish made with different spices, soy sauce, and a pork/chicken broth that is suite and rich.  Their name was anglicized and frankified, so I don't remember what they called it.  The broth was great. The meet was not cooked as long as it should, so it didn't have the tenderness that this dish normally has.  But it was tasty and the fresh pulled hand made noodles were delightful. 
2.  PORK WITH PICKLED VEGETABLES: T his is a traditional chinese dish too.  The broth is oilier, but delightful and the flavors were rich and good.  A little bit of spiciness, but not much.  
3.  WONTON NOODLES:  The kids had this.  The broth was more delicate and good. 
4.  SPICY COLD PIG EARS:  I know.  Sounds gross.  Eh?  Delicious.  Spicy in the Schichuan style with hot and tingly or ""mala"" spicing.  

NEXT TIME:  Want to dry the noodles with beef-dza jia mien.  My wife makes this and it's wonderful.  Want to try it.  

BADS:  Waitress was kind of disintrested.  No decor at all.  

INFORMATION:  1.  I don't know the English name of this restaurant.
2.  I don't know the exact address, but it's near Epicerie Lam Kee just to the sounth. 
3.  Lan zhou noodles are normally made with a kind of naturally occuring chemical used in Japanese and Chinese noodles sometimes called ""kansui"".  I don't know if they used it here, since it usually imparts a yellowish color to the noodle, and these were very white.  
4.  In New York, I would give this a slightly lower rating.  This was a joint rating by me and my Chinese wife.  We thought about 1/2 to 1 star lower for Manhattan.","4 star rating"

Gives me and menu and says what would you like,i haven't even had a chance to flip open the menu, you just gave it to me. So he stood there awkwardly and I just ordered quickly. They say us split between two tables. So us being nice, notice it getting busy and tell them we'll squeeze into one table so they can serve other people. Well I ask for water. Food comes, one at a time, atleast ten mins apart, so by the last person, it's was all cold. Fine.. it's okay ur busy. I ask for water again. We finish eating, still no water. My dad gets up and asks for water, the guy starts pouring a glass infront of him and I'm like seriously? No we want water for the whole table my dad can't bring it all. So my dad sits and we wait. NO WATER. I ask again. The guy comes back with a pitcher.. we have no glasses. So he comes back with ONE glass of water. NO I want water for everyone. And he says: we have no glasses left and proceeded to pour the water in our tea.... I MEAN WHAT THE ACTUAL ******!!?? Sorry, just the principle, you guys are always busy so you know what to expect.

Fresh, quick and tasty. Non-expectations? Variety, room to stretch, exchanging patter with the staff. Oh, and at a very very reasonable price.  This Chinese beef noodle shop is everything one can reasonably want. The noodles are stretched and slapped and twirled and twisted in the front window. Based on the orders, the noodle-maker prepares different sizes, plops a portion into a vat of boiling water. A few minutes later, another person scoops up the noodles, drains them and puts them in a bowl, to which a ladle or two of simmering  clear beed broth is added. At the next station is the daikon, cilantro, chili oil (if so requested), beef slices, tea egg (if requested). There are three sizes and the medium is enough for a football player. There are a few other items like spicy cucumber and edamame. We had two small beef noodle soups, with moxi and Jo Yen style noodles. There are few seats, maybe ten tables and another ten at the counters, so we had to wait ten minutes for a table. Service was fast, price was great! If you are looking for cantonese or Szechuan or Thai or a Chinese banquet, there are a dozen other places within blocks. This place is for beef noodles.","5 star rating"

I came here on a Friday night and it was pretty packed. I was with my girlfriend and had to wait around 10 minutes after ordering at the counter to be seated. Since it was so busy, we ended up sharing our booth with another couple. I didn't mind this too much because the booths were long enough to not be disturbed. 

When we received our meals, we noticed at first bite that the food was not as hot as what you'd expect at restaurants. It tasted like it was removed from its heat source a while before and had cooled down quite a lot. Nonetheless, we continued to eat because the flavours took us back to our trip to Thailand. The dishes were quite authentic. However, the fried Chinese broccoli and crispy pork dish somewhat disappointed. The flavours were great, but there was a total of 4 small pieces of the pork, even though it was charged extra by roughly $4. Yes, $4 is not much, but I was still expecting there to be more than just a bite for a dish costing roughly $12 (without the added fee for crispy pork). 

Overall, if I go back, I'd try the pad Thai even though it's not the most genuine Thai dish. It seemed like it was freshly made as there was steam coming from the dish. Also, I did not enjoy the interactions with the woman at the counter taking our orders. She did not seem friendly at all and did not bother to speak up a little bit louder as the restaurant was quite loud.","2 star rating"

I liked the interior, really gave me the vibe of being in Thailand. Their menu was with authentic Thai names and a small description. 

I would like to preface this review saying that my boyfriend and I love spicy food and very often eat it. We've got an extensive hot sauce collection and use it for almost every meal at home. So we can eat spicy food. 

I ordered the curry vert and he ordered some pork stir fry that I don't remember the name of. The food was made to order and brought to us at the table outside. It looked great! Then we took some bites, it was ridiculously spicy. I am Asian and have eaten many curries, but never had a spectacularly spicy green curry, it's usually mild. Both of our dishes were so spicy, that we couldn't finish them. We drank so much water while eating, and water doesn't help spice attacks. 

After, we had the mango sticky rice, which wasn't bad. It's one of my favourite desserts, but I've had better. 

This wasn't the end... as we are walking home, I start hearing my stomach rumble and then begin experiencing significant pain. Let's just say it was a very rough evening. My boyfriend was spared, until the middle of the night, when he had terrible pains as well. Both of us continued to feel sick until the morning. This morning. 

In future, there should be a warning of exactly how spicy the items are. Given how much we like spicy food, I didn't think it would be such a problem, but it felt like we were swallowing molten lava.","3 star rating"

Flavors of each dish were extraordinary. They offer many vegan dishes and my order was ready in just 10 min! 
My favorite dish was Gaeng Kari, which is a Thai curry soup and it had seasonal vegetables (tomatoes, potatoes and eggplant). I also have to say that their fried chicken was some of the best I've had and it stayed perfectly crispy even after a 30 min drive home.

We ordered:
1. Gaeng Kari vegan
2. Pad thai
3. Pad kaprao porc (spicy ground porc with rjce and egg)
4. Fried chicken
5. Gaeng Kiow wan (green curry soup)
6. yum galamplee vegan (salad)

I came here on a Friday night and it was pretty packed. I was with my girlfriend and had to wait around 10 minutes after ordering at the counter to be seated. Since it was so busy, we ended up sharing our booth with another couple. I didn't mind this too much because the booths were long enough to not be disturbed. 

When we received our meals, we noticed at first bite that the food was not as hot as what you'd expect at restaurants. It tasted like it was removed from its heat source a while before and had cooled down quite a lot. Nonetheless, we continued to eat because the flavours took us back to our trip to Thailand. The dishes were quite authentic. However, the fried Chinese broccoli and crispy pork dish somewhat disappointed. The flavours were great, but there was a total of 4 small pieces of the pork, even though it was charged extra by roughly $4. Yes, $4 is not much, but I was still expecting there to be more than just a bite for a dish costing roughly $12 (without the added fee for crispy pork). 

Overall, if I go back, I'd try the pad Thai even though it's not the most genuine Thai dish. It seemed like it was freshly made as there was steam coming from the dish. Also, I did not enjoy the interactions with the woman at the counter taking our orders. She did not seem friendly at all and did not bother to speak up a little bit louder as the restaurant was quite loud.","2 star rating"

I liked the interior, really gave me the vibe of being in Thailand. Their menu was with authentic Thai names and a small description. 

I would like to preface this review saying that my boyfriend and I love spicy food and very often eat it. We've got an extensive hot sauce collection and use it for almost every meal at home. So we can eat spicy food. 

I ordered the curry vert and he ordered some pork stir fry that I don't remember the name of. The food was made to order and brought to us at the table outside. It looked great! Then we took some bites, it was ridiculously spicy. I am Asian and have eaten many curries, but never had a spectacularly spicy green curry, it's usually mild. Both of our dishes were so spicy, that we couldn't finish them. We drank so much water while eating, and water doesn't help spice attacks. 

After, we had the mango sticky rice, which wasn't bad. It's one of my favourite desserts, but I've had better. 

This wasn't the end... as we are walking home, I start hearing my stomach rumble and then begin experiencing significant pain. Let's just say it was a very rough evening. My boyfriend was spared, until the middle of the night, when he had terrible pains as well. Both of us continued to feel sick until the morning. This morning. 

In future, there should be a warning of exactly how spicy the items are. Given how much we like spicy food, I didn't think it would be such a problem, but it felt like we were swallowing molten lava.","3 star rating"

I was quite impressed with this cute little resteraunt/mini marketplace in little italy. Pad Thai was amazing, the right amount of flavor and a generous amount of noodles that lasted me two meals. I also really enjoyed the red curry which had such a great blend of veggies, spices, and a really generous amount of chicken that was perfectly cooked and tender. I really need to try the fried chicken as well as I've seen so many great reviews for it. Expect to pay 14-15+, but it's so worth it!

Aren't we lucky!? 

We ordered the green curry (spicy), the pad Thai (of course), by the way, this is the best pad Thai I have had in Montreal, and the crispy chicken wings. So good! I fully appreciated the dinner style ambiance of the place. Very chill and non-pretentious. Although, be careful when you grab a seat.

It's super shocking that the best Thai food I ever had was here in Canada when I came to visit colleges in Montreal for the weekend. I'm from Southern California and I've had tons of Thai food and for some reason Pumpui is just magical!!! 

I had the beef panache. I would have to say my favorite food is probably anything that's served with a fried egg on top--But seriously this beef panang was KILLER!! It was the best I've ever had and I've had it many times in the USA. The meal is made from ground beef mixed with tons of spicy hot chili peppers and basil and mint. The staff warned me this was the HOTTEST dish they made. But between you and me it could be hotter. I even added chili oil on it after a few bites. It was still amazing though and I wish I could have more of it right now !! 

My friends also got the basic pad Thai and a chicken curry dish but we were all blown away at how spectacular the food was for being so simple and again for being made in this small place in the middle of Montreal. Amazing! Truly the best!! Congrats to the chefs--you're awesome!","5 star rating"

The menu is quite straightforward, you can also just look at the food right behind the glass pane and you'd probably end up doing what I did by ordering almost everything... My friends were late and I didn't even wait for them to order... :P
We took quite a few things: 
-the papaya salad (wasn't my fav as I'm not a fan of the raw green beans and I think the dried shrimps could have used a bit of smashing)
-Pad Thai
-fried chicken hmmmmm...
-a few curries: pork belly, fish and the jungle one which were all very yummy!

A good try but likely wont come back, the meal was worth ~30$ than the ~50$ we spent considering all the food is preprepared in a cafeteria style (we also got a hibiscus mint iced tea that sounded a lot better than it tasted; barely any mint taste and very tart from the hibiscus)","3 star rating"

Épicerie Pumpui is a 'lan khao gangs' - a combination curry shop and grocery store that is common in Thailand but mostly nonexistent in North America and certainly here in Montreal. Chef Jesse Mulder - who had run Thai delivery service Chak Wow prior to opening this brick and mortar spot - and his partners opened up Pumpui a little less than 2 years ago.

The space is very casual in style - with about 12 seats in-house and ordering at the counter. The small grocery section sells a variety of Thai ingredients and items. The menu is relatively small - 5 ready to serve options and then another 5 or 6 a la carte items. The menu consists mostly of curries and more obscure dishes for a North American audience as well as a few other 'classic' dishes like Pad Thai and green curry.

First off, I went with the fried chicken wings with sweet chili sauce. Pumpui has developed a reputation for these and yeah I can see why. These were amazing - super crunchy skin, very tender inside and a nice sweet heat coating them. I just needed more!

After the wings, I decided to try the Curry Hunglay - a Burmese pork belly, shallot and ginger curry. Had never heard of this dish until I saw it on the menu and enjoyed it tremendously. Very generous portion overall. The curry was mildly spiced which suited my relatively weak spice palette. A nice combination of richness, sweetness and spice. The pork belly was super tender as were the shallots which was a different way for me to enjoy them. An excellent discovery for me.

On my second visit, I started with a Hibiscus mint iced tea which was very bright and refreshing.

I then decided on the Asii Pian - a dry curry of chicken, thai eggplant, tomatoes, lemongrass and galangal from the Shan region. I had never heard of galangal which is more citrus and piney version of ginger. Very different flavour which came through strongly with the sharp lemongrass notes. Again, like the previous curry, tons of flavour and a very hardy portion. Another hit for me. 

Given how the majority of true Thai restaurant in the city are more formal affairs, it is great to have such a great Thai counter service to get great flavourful and more unique curry for a quick lunch, takeout or dinner. I know it seems weird to head to Little Italy for Thai cuisine but believe me, it is well worth it.

I was super excited to try Pumpui after hearing raving reviews from multiple foodie friends. 
It's a small epicerie counter service type spot, where they have some pre made curries as well as items made to order. They sell some specialty grocery products, as well as a variety of novelty drinks. I got myself a grapefruit la croix! The restaurant itself cozy but seats are super limited. 
I got the fried chicken, catfish in red curry, and the pork with morning glory. 
The fried chicken was absolutely amazing. Loved the marinade and the sauce, delightfully crispy! Sweet, tangy and spicy. Haven't had fried chicken this good tbh. It was $8 for 3 pieces. 
The catfish was a bit tough in my opinion, and quite spicy. Still an excellent dish though! 
The pork flank was extremely tender and the morning glory went perfectly with the sauce. 
Both curry dishes are served with rice and everything had a unique and complex flavour profile. 
The food was still a bit pricey despite the no-frills eatery vibe, but in terms of quality, it was worth the price.","5 star rating"

You can play it safe and get the pad thai with shrimp if you must, but if you need some real HEAT you've got some great options here. Pak boong is stir fried morning glory greens with a lot of chilis and garlic and it's so satisfyingly hot but if you want to step into the irresistible fire of the bird's eye choose the item with 'kaprao' in its name. You will momentarily die in the fire--but then awaken with knowledge of the afterlife. Not everything on the menu is this intense so don't be frightened.

Pad Thai was very fishy and the green curry doesn't even compare at all to Restaurant Thailand just a 10 minute walk away. It's also very crowded and while the service is good it's so crowded that the server had to reach over me (I had to duck while eating) so he could get water for other guests. Also there isn't a single Thai person there. It was a very hipster kind of a vibe and staff, and it was crowded, loud, and not super comfortable, but the food was solid. Not exceptional, but solid.

I came a day after opening where apparently they pulled in excess of 300 customers which is impressive for such a small place.

The menu is scrawled on sheets above the kitchen counter, prices are attached beside in Sharpie. Prices generally range from $12-16. There's no offer of a menu either on their Facebook or their webpage, and I think you can expect the menu to change regularly.

I ordered a fish curry noodle soup (the name escapes me) for takeout; unfortunately, I couldn't get to it until two hours later by which time the noodles had overcooked, but no fault of theirs. 

According to interviews, they're making a point of offering Thai fare aside from the usual standards of pad thai and green curries that you'll find in most Thai establishments. Even after tasting some mind blowing Thai food in San Francisco earlier this year, there were savory, herbaceous flavors in the curry I couldn't even identify (Thai turmeric?).

The portion is generous and the price is quite a bit lower than other good south East Asian restaurants (Red Tiger, Satay brothers, etc). Of course it's cheaper because it's cafeteria style, but for those days that you just don't want to cook, it's perfect. The vegetarian options are substantial, making it a perfect lunch date option with your vegan friend (I love their fish special tho).

There was no wait when I got here today just before noon, and although they are definitely having some opening-week anxiety and mix ups and some menu items weren't available, I was totally delighted with my vegetarian option - a thick and creamy red curry with big chunks of lovely tofu and squash and crispy tart black tomatoes, served with a plate of rice. Service was warm and thoughtful, and the decor is lovely and relaxing and does feel like a loving ode to Thailand. I worry about the cultural appropriation piece, it all feels so full of love for authentic food and culture that I think Pumpui's heart is in the right place, but it will be for Thai people to judge.

Okay so now about the delicious food. My partner and I ordered the papaya salad to start, which was fresh and a bit spicy with small dried shrimps stirred together (never tried that); it provided a crunchy and flavorful texture but a slightly fishy taste. For our mains, we shared a pad thai and a curry, both with tofu and one with shrimp. They were divine! So extremely flavorful, piping hot, and absolutely delightful for the senses. The aromas were fantastic and after a long day of fasting, their food did not disappoint.

As someone who has spent a lot of time in Thailand, I don't believe that a Pad Thai is supposed to be cold and clumped up together into a heaping pile of noodles. Aside from that, there was not enough flavour and was not at all indicative of cuisine in Thailand. We also got something like an eggplant and pumpkin curry. Flavour was good, but either the eggplant skin or the pumpkin rind wasn't cooked for long enough and left an unfavourable texture, and a chew that was not at all pleasurable. On a good side, the Papaya Salad was lovely - crunchy, good texture and good balance of salty, sweet, sour and spicy. The fried chicken was also great. The restaurant itself is cute. It's half a grocery store, so it doesn't seat very many people. But the booths are clean and comfortable.","3 star rating"

The pad Thai was a generous portion and the flavours were amazing. I don't generally like tofu but I have to admit it was delicious in this dish. The papaya salad unfortunately, I had to throw out. The flavours were making me uneasy and the dehydrated shrimp that topped the salad left a lingering taste I just couldn't shake. Otherwise, I absolutely adore this place and can't wait to go back and try some of their curries!","4 star rating"

"1666670436-7517","https://www.yelp.ca/search?find_desc=thai+food&find_loc=Montreal%2C+QC&start=0","Pumpui","https://www.yelp.ca/biz/pumpui-montr%C3%A9al-2?osq=thai+food","","These folks nail quite a lot that many establishments don't. First off, they know the scope of what they are going for and play well to it, both in type of service, decor, and keeping a menu small enough that their kitchen can handle it without compromise. Nothing tried to outdo their limitations and I liked that a lot. Their menu is small but covers items that less adventurous can enjoy, while offering a few select items for someone picky (like me) will go for. Most importantly, even though nothing was overly 'exotic' or particularly spicy, their flavours are good. And I mean VERY good. I know Thai food very well, and make it all from scratch, so when I think a somewhat mild curry is deep and complex with a wide range of flavours that says a lot about the prep they do. Their curries were actually 3 dimensional, something so few places know how to do. My kid, who doesn't love much other than Pad Thai LOVED their version, and it was so nice to see them make every dish of it individually, as one needs to.

Something else I really appreciated is their design/decor; while going for the low key corner cafe/street food vibe they did it with something that matched the setting. Sure, plastic stools and dirty Thai movie posters are what you'd expect in most eating experiences in Thailand, but in Montreal it would feel a bit put on, and I appreciated that they didn't over do this and simply do what works best for them. It makes it more true, and in fact felt MORE like an authentic Bangkok / SE Asia experience as a result, if that makes sense. 

Finally, what I noticed most was that everyone, and I mean everyone, was friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there. It's like they get it, this is a cool place, doing cool things, get treated as respected employees, and everyone just enjoys themselves. This is a bit of conjecture of course, but that's the vibe I got.

So yeah, 4+ stars for doing so many things right, and with ease. I'll only take half a star off because yes, they COULD have at least one or two dishes that blows the lid off and challenges people, especially since I went there on the suggestion that they were doing Southern Thai recipes, which on the night I was there they weren't. That said, the menu rotates and in that sense it's a local experience and if I had opportunity go weekly (or daily) I might feel different. I'll def be back next time in town and who knows maybe add another 1/2 star. In the meantime, this place is near the top of my Thai go to's anywhere, highly recommended.","4 star rating"

Half grocery store selling specialty Thai products, half restaurant. You order at a cafeteria type counter and enjoy your meal in the seating area (big enough for 12-15 people).

I ordered the red curry. It was spicy, rich, flavorful. So good! Can't wait to return!

I have lived near Restaursnt Thaïlande for about 2 years now. 

I love Thai food. I have travelled to Thailand so I know a thing or two. On top of it , I have a very high standard for Thai food. 

So , the green curry prepared by Restaurant Thaïlande is excellent. I love love love it! I order the green curry with two orders of sticky rice. I find by doing this it turns the one order of green curry into a full dinner and then a nice snack the next day , or later on ;)

Top notch green curry you will be very happy with it. 

Have a great time!

I had walked past this restaurant hundreds of time when I lived in the mile end but never gave it a second glance. I'm so thankful that my friends recommended eating here otherwise I might not have pushed myself to give it a try!

Everything I had to eat and drink was delicious. The Tom Yom soup had so many layers of full-bodied flavors. The spring rolls didn't taste frozen; the chicken skewer and peanut butter dumplings were extremely satisfying. I can't recall or find the name of my main dish but it was a semi-spicy coconut curry with a side of sticky rice. There was a choice of lamb, chicken, duck, shrimp or vegetables for the main dish. I can't rave enough about the food. It's the best Thai restaurant I've ever been able to have the pleasure of eating at. 

The prices were incredibly reasonable. I shared a dinner menu with a friend and had more than enough to eat.

The interior is lovely and if you reserve in advance you can ask for a table where you sit on cushions on the floor. 

I hope to return again soon and will definitely be recommending this restaurant to friends and family.","5 star rating"

Visited Restaurant Thailande on a Friday evening after work with friends. We had reserved the traditional-style raised cushion seating beforehand - I highly recommend trying this out at it is a great experience. You have to remove your shoes then unroll the cushion and prop yourself in the space. It is sooo comfy! There are plenty of tables however if you prefer.

The ambiance is warm and intimate, great for a date or dinner with friends. The staff are very friendly and respectful, regularly filling water glasses up and bringing the food out quickly.

For starters, we ordered the 'Mee Krob' - crispy noodles marinated with shrimps in sweet & sour sauce. It was OK - I would not order it again as it was quite simple and something I could make at home. We also had the 'Por Pia Tod' Deep fried egg rolls (which were delicious!) and the 'Kiao Satay' Dumplings in peanut sauce (tasty and great for a small group to share as you get about 15 small dumplings)

For mains, we had to order the famous 'Thai Green Curry' (Kaeng Khiao Wan) made with coconut milk, basil & shrimps. It was delicious, lovely with sticky or steamed rice.  We also had the 'Kaeng Panaeng' curry which was spicier and very tasty. My favourite however was the 'Pad Kimao' - spicy rice noodles with hot chillis and onions. Extremely flavourful with the perfect amount of heat. 

Overall, great first experience of authentic Thai food and culture. Prices are reasonable, food is flavoursome and charming ambiance. Highly recommend :)","4 star rating"

He came back with two sliced limes which is not enough for a table of 4. Then the order came quickly where I asked for additional hot sauce, but the waiter forgot. The food was mediocre and truly lacked flavors that reflect the delicious and authentic Thai cuisine. The waiter also never checked in with us to ask how our meal was.

I will typically base my rating of Thai restaurants on the quality of their Pad Si Ew, and this place was a-okay. It had a very nice interior, the waiters/waitresses were very accomadating and the food came out very quickly which is always a plus. 

So, the Pad Si Ew itself. Not bad, but not excellent either. The noodles weren't as large and flat as I'd like them to normally be, it was a bit on the oily side, the beef was a bit tough, and worst of all, the dish had American broccoli instead of Chinese ones! That's usually a big alert to me, so I was pretty skeptic at first. However, once I had a few bites, it wasn't too bad.

Boyfriend's brother recommended this place and we decided to come here as the first Thai restaurant experience in Montreal one night. I gotta say, I was a little skeptical when I walked in the place. Mostly because the ambiance is very nice and the restaurant is labeled as fine dining Asian cuisines. Though I enjoy nice ambiances, my best authentic Thai dining experiences (from the food perspective) always comes exclusively from hole-in-the-wall restaurants.

The menu is in Thai with some descriptions in French/English, a great sign for authentic food. I ordered Pad Kimao (otherwise known as drunken noodle) and boyfriend ordered Pad Prik Khing (a chicken dish cooked with ginger and beans). Being a lover of spice foods, I asked them turn the spiciness for my Pad Kimao to the max. My Pad Kimao was sauteed to perfection, the scent of basil heightened the flavor of the dish; the spiciness from the chilli peppers was well placed and fully expressed; the chicken was thinly sliced, tender and flavorful, especially with a dash of garlic on top. What a beautiful and tasty dish! Boyfriend's Pad Prik Khing was also delicious, with rice on the side, the ginger and beans were sauteed with chicken in a spicy sauce, the flavor was even more pronounced.

Overall, I was very pleased with the experience! It's more pricey than your normal Thai places, but the plating is beautiful, ambiance romantic and the food wonderfully tasty and authentic, well worth the price.","4 star rating"

Man thats one steep bill. 

We also had the green curry and red curry. Green curry was not spicy at all. The red curry dish was much more flavorful and had an authentic thai spicyness.

The crispy duck was not even crispy at all. 

The shrimp pad thai literally had 4 shrimp....like really???? Youre joking right? Flavor was decent but noodles were too wet

I enjoy the duck salad. Beef salad was dry chewy as hell....

PS. All mushroom you see looks like they come straight from the can. 

150$ total bill. 

An alright place but wont be coming back any time soon. Phayathai is much better if you ask me.","2 star rating"

I ordered the green mango salad as a main (as I had decided that poutine + sangria directly after yoga and before such a meal was a very sound decision) and was really happy with the price/quality ratio. The salad was really delish - accented with mint and cilantro and lime (I think!) and topped with shrimp and was ~10$. Not bad! Also! Have you ever had thai iced tea?!

A very tasty Tom Yum soup was our starter along with a 3-item appetizer that was spectacular - wontons with peanut sauce was the highlight with a very good spring roll and chicken satay.  Had crispy chicken and shrimp with eggplant and peppers - both main dishes were very well executed.  Atmosphere was very good as we sat in the no-shoes seating area with the low tables and cushions.  Price was excellent, very reasonable for a 27-Zagat rated restaurant - about $60 for two people.

I love love love Thai food, so I was very excited to give it a shot. I had a fish Tom Yum Kha soup to start ($4.95), which was tiny and not very flavourful, except for being too sweet. For me the whole point of ordering that soup is the rich coconutty base, but alas, I couldn't taste the coconut at all.

Next up was vegetable Pad Prik Khing ($12.95) which is is a kind of spicy (not really) thin red curry sauce. It was ok, but nothing special. The vegetables (only broccoli and cauliflower... really?) were a bit over cooked as well. The sticky rice was sticky rice, what can I say?

People don't realize how hard it is to find basic Thai dishes in this city, dishes that are standard in most Thai restaurants in the diaspora, such as pad kee mao (drunken noodles) or yam neua (spicy beef salad). So, A+ for variety, and a solid A for execution. My husband and I were both impressed by the freshness of the produce, the bold flavours, and the spiciness. We ordered both of the aforementioned dishes as well as dumplings in peanut sauce and a tofu/vegetables dish in a spicy coconut milk sauce; everything was cooked beautifully, the beef salad in particular. This is also a great spot for vegetarians, as almost everything can be made with tofu. The noodles were slightly overdone and the sauces a tad sweet with too much tomato paste, but honestly, it was vastly superior to everything else I've tasted since moving and I'm overjoyed.

Me and hubby always look for nice Asian restaurant to go to every Sunday evening. The decor is quite nice so we didn't expect cheap food but as long as it's worth it. We ordered papaya salad to share. The flavor was good but a bit sweeter than I prefer. The portion was. Quite small.  As usual, he ordered Pad Thai chicken which came out a bit too soggy but again the flavor  wasn't bad and the price is reasonable. Though we've had better Pad Thai at many Asian resto. I tried their Hormok Plat (fish steamed in banana leaf). Again flavor was good, but the fish was so mushy that it fell apart. It was just really watery. The iceberg and basil in the sauce were all gooey and over killed. There were just a few bites of fish in that whole banana bowl. The rice was extra charge.  I find the same dish at  la petite Mangue at a much lower price and a good amount of fish that isn't watery like this. We also ordered two drink at first. He took bloody Cesar which was so disgustingly bitter that he had to stop half way through and ordered another glass of white wine instead. I had a rather not so cold piña colada mixed  instead of blended and icy cold. The bill came to well over$100. The waiter was friendly but the food and drinks were a bit of a let down.

Menu has a lot of choice, but I was a little disappointed with the portion sizes. I had decided to not take the Table d'Hote because I thought it would've been too much food, but in hindsight, because of the smaller portion sizes it would've done me just fine. I had the peanut butter dumplings to start (shared with Danny), and Pad Kana Namman Hoi as my entree. I also shared a plate of chicken fried rice with Danny, but were left still hungry at the end of our meal. Don't get me wrong, the food was very good, but the price for the portions we got left something to be desired.

To start off, there was a long wait time for the food to be served. On top of that, the chicken wings are not fully cooked(see picture). 
Then there's the quality of the food, I'm sorry, I'm no Gordon Ramsay, but it taste worse than fast food. The crispy shrimp rolls has some weird oil taste, it taste like they haven't change the fried oil for a long time. Then there is the pad Thai, not sure if it's overcooked or what, but a good authentic pad thai shouldn't be that wet, the noodle is way too soft.

We ordered Thai chicken wings and papaya salad which were pretty good, but unfortunately I ordered crispy fried noodle instead of pad Thai due to the misunderstanding of the menu,which only had some weird noodles and vegetables simply stir fried, not very tasty and special,and it's more expensive than pad Thai !

I also like their tea. It's different than the jasmine tea you get at Chinese restaurants and the green tea served at Japanese restaurants.

Although small and unassuming, the restaurant had an intimate, fine-dining setting with excellent service. The food tasted authentic and was simply delicious. For the best experience, dishes should be shared family-style, as they were around $20 and portions were generous. The pad thai noodles are a must have--they are well seasoned and textured, stir fried to perfection, and unlike any other pad thai I've tasted. The curries (red, green, panaeng) were all aromatic and delicious as well. I was impressed by the presentation of each dish..nothing about this place was sloppy! Had a great dinner experience here and would definitely go back again.","5 star rating"

The spice level was great.  If you ask for it to be hot then it comes hot!   I found that many restaurants in Montreal had a much lower spice level.  Even if you asked for it to be really kicking. 
These folks get it right. 

The only drawback is that it is more expensive than you'd expect.   Maybe 20% more than other nicer Thai places.  

But if you aren't impacted by that then you'll be happy you went here.","5 star rating"

Po Taek soup is a classic Thai seafood dish, and this was executed to perfection. The flavours were perfectly balanced, which can be hard to come by with this particular dish. The seafood was also quite generous in serving size and excellent in quality.

We're huge fans of duck, and we'd never seen Larp Ped (Duck Lemongrass Salad) on a menu before. This lemongrass duck salad was a revelation, with a flavour profile that changed as you enjoyed the dish

The Kung Prik Sod, a  chili shrimp dish, was inevitable as the soup made it clear that the quality of the shrimp was fantastic, large, firm and sweet.

Kob Phad Kha Poa caught our eye immediately; we've never seen frog's legs on a Thai menu, and served with ""crispy basil""? We had to try it, and thank God we did! We love frog's legs, and these were the best we've ever had. Plump, meaty, juicy and flavour infused. Most notably however, was the crispy basil. These beautiful large basil leaves were carefully flash fried. We were so astounded at the texture and flavour we had to ask the server about them. He explained that they are carefully fried on a pan in a single layer, for no more than thirty seconds. Not only was it a trip to eat crispy basil, but the heat released the flavours normally locked in the leave's natural oil, making the taste unforgettable.

The menu probably had over 50 things so as a newbie it was a bit overwhelming - but the waiter was very attentive in answering our questions in terms of tastes.

Before coming here my friend and I took a look at the menu on their website and we're pleased to see the amount of vegetarians options available for him. Unfortunately the prices reflected on the website were different than those we saw in the restaurant. 

I ended up getting the chicken with red curry & coconut milk and got it less spicy than how they usually make it, along with some steamed jasmine rice. To say that I was impressed was an understatement. The flavor really pops out and if you're not a spice fan (like me) the spiciness hit the back of your throat and wasn't overbearing.

We arrived at around 5:30pm on a Friday and were the 2nd people to get there (the place closes for a few hours and reopens at 5pm). So It was pretty quiet and had a soothing atmosphere. Around 6:30pm is where it got busy, and we noticed them putting reserved signs on about 6 tables (which is a lot for this small place). From then on it was pretty busy but not overbearing. I think we had the best seat in there - which was against the wall near a fire place - as 2 other couples requested to have this spot once we were done.

Overall I was very impressed and would like to go back. One downfall is the price. It is pretty pricey for the portion you get then you have to add on things like rice. I would recommend if you're going with people with like tastes then order numerous dishes and just share everything. I was only halfway done with my dish when we left so I was able to get it in a to go box.","4 star rating"

The Wait
We went there for Dinner on a Friday night around 9 PM with no prior reservation. The place was packed, but they told us that there was a couple leaving and they would have a table ready for us in 15 mins. Despite the couple leaving about 10 mins after that, none of the wait staff cared to clean the tables, until we went inside and reminded them about it twice. During this period, someone that was smoking a cigarette outside (seemed like the owner) was going back in, and asked us if we were waiting for a table. He went inside, and started cleaning the table himself, and set-up the new table. We were finally seated after 30 mins. There was also a lingering smell of cigarette smoke around our table.

The Place
It is a small place with space for about 35-40 people max. The décor is semi-modern, but the place seems a bit cramped up. There is a small make-shift bar, where they would mix drinks if someone ordered a cocktail.

The Food
We ordered Fried Tofu for appetizer, Green curry with vegetables & Vegetable Fried Rice. Fried tofu was very bland (pretty standard). The green curry and fried rice were tasty, but only average at the best. The service was terribly slow, and everyone around food took a while to come, not just for us, but for almost everyone there.

The Check
We had a glass of wine, a beer, one small appetizer, one curry, and fried rice. The total check was around $85 + gratuity, which is pretty expensive for an average Thai Restaurant

Since we are not from the area, it is highly unlikely that we would ever return to this place. 

Beware - If you are trying to go for a night out after dinner, and are the kind that is bothered by the smell of your clothes after dinner, this is not the place for you. Your clothes are definitely going to smell like food after a visit to this place.","3 star rating"

The atmosphere was very comfortable as well. I personally thought the service was a bit slow, but overall decent. The waiters took awhile to come by and clear our plates and also to give us the bill. 

But enough about that, let's talk food. The soups were honestly the highlight of the night. My boyfriend had an amazing shrimp mushroom coconut soup while I had a superb shrimp tom yum soup. It was really rich in flavor. For the main, I ordered mushrooms with thai basil and boy, was it super spicy.  This dish had 3 chili pepper signs next to it on the menu, but I think it actually tasted like 4 chili peppers. But I like spicy food so I didn't mind. My friend had a brown curry called panang with tofu. That was really good too. My boyfriend and his friend both ordered the shrimp pad thai which was both disappointing surprisingly. My bf said the sauce overpowered everything while his friend seemed to like it.

For appetizers, we had a shrimp tom yum, which was listed as 2 chilis on the spicy scale, and was nicely perfumed as well; spring rolls, imperial rolls, (which I didn't taste but which my dining companions enjoyed very much); a papaya salad that was quite spicy; and a salad of beef sauteed with chilis that was nice and tender.

Mains were a red curry of pork and bamboo shoots; a green curry loaded with fish, squid and shrimp as well as zucchini and Thai eggplant; noodles with chicken and basil; and bbq crispy duck. I expected the green curry to be hotter than the red but they were about the same. I was disappointed with the noodles as I couldn't seem to locate the meat in it. The duck, on the other hand, was wonderfully crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside. The sauce complemented it nicely without overpowering it.

We had green tea icecream and mango icecream for dessert. It was the usual fare - nothing to write home about. However, the banana fritters were light and crispy, which is rare.

The decor is classy and discreet, and the staff were friendly and helpful. It was not cheap though at $150 (inc tax, sans tip), considering we drank tea. I enjoyed my food quite a lot but wouldn't rave about it.","3 star rating"

So I have a pretty good baseline to judge Thai food.

 I'm pretty sure that Phayathai has one of the best pad thai I've tried in the city, it's more on the saucy side which I also like, and we also ordered a spicy peanut sauce chicken - it was soooooo good. I can't wait to try the Green curry next time and compare it to the restaurant in the middle east as well as compare it to Bangkok Garden in Toronto. 4 instead of 5 stars, because it's a touch pricey but it is a white table cloth type of place and super clean - I still want to find a cheap tasty thai place for regular day cravings

*** I've now been here maybe 5-6 times. We always get the pad Thai - it's always incredible. The green curry is delicious (but I always ask to remove the green peppers, and add bamboo, because they only put bamboo in their red curry, but I like it in my green curry). The chicken panang curry is also a favourite, and the red curry chicken is very tasty as well.

I would have much rather preferred sliced duck. We then had the pad thai (only 2 shrimps) and the chicken with peanut sauce with crispy spinach, both very good.

Why 3 stars? First I thought the service was very slow. We were the only ones in the restaurant. I understand there was a big take out order but still! Second, the bill came to close to 60$ for 1 appetizer, 2 main dishes and 1 bowl of rice!  I don't expect to pay this much for an Asian restaurant (beside sushi).

I ordered a small Tom Kha Kai soup (~$5) (chicken in coconut milk and lemongrass), the Paneang Chicken (~$17), and two sticky rice (~$7), the bill came out to $40 tax and tip included. This is a bit on the expensive side for one person, especially considering that the food was average for a proper Thai restaurant. When the soup came, it was mediocre at best. The broth used a lower quality diluted coconut milk. The texture of the chicken was off and tasted as if it had been microwaved. The Paneang Chicken and the sticky rice were average for a Thai restaurant, but not the same quality as I've come to expect and definitely not acceptable for the price. It turns out that there's been an owner change at this location about 3 years ago. I'll be heading to the laurier location for the full blissful experience next time.","2 star rating"

This was a last minute reservation as a lot of restaurants were fully booked and I'm glad we came here because the food is phenomenal!

We ordered: 
Curry puffs ($14)
Duck wontons ($17)
Pad seew w/ filet mignon ($25)
Ginger chicken stir fry ($26)
Thai roasted chicken fried rice ($27)

The duck wontons were really flavorful and packed with filling! These were so delicious!! The curry puffs were also good but duck wontons were definitely the show stealer.

The paw seew was good but a little bit too salty. I liked the chewy texture of the noodles a lot. The ginger chicken stir fry was a little disappointing. It didn't have a lot of flavor and the chicken was kind of dry. The Thai roasted chicken fried rice, on the other hand, was insanely good! It even came with a whole roasted chicken! The chicken was super tender and paired well with the sauce it came with. I'm glad it even came with pickled cucumbers. It helped cut through the grease and heaviness of the chicken and rice. 

The restaurant was so pretty and i loved the ambiance. I wish I can come back just for this restaurant!","5 star rating"

We tried the pad sew (rice noodles, sirloin and gailan) and the vegetarian yellow curry (tofu, bamboo, baby corn, tomatoes). Both were super flavourful and heavily seasoned. The noodles had a generous portion of meat (too much? could've used more noodles ).

The hostess was nice  when seating us and the food runner that brought out our food was nice as well and the food came out quick.  The issue was with our server I believe his name was Rapheal.

Then when he took our order(which he started with what would you like to order, not, would you like to start with apps or drinks) he seemed just quiet which was fine.  But the issue was  after the drinks and food came. When he brought both our waters and cocktails he served my husband first. I didn't make too much of that until my husband, who worked in the restaurant industry for 17 years, pointed out it was very unusual to serve the man first. Then he seemed to not want to come back to our table.  At one point I ran out of water and sat my cup toward the end of the table and multiple times our waiter and the other server kept passing us by with the water jug. But what was strange was that I saw them both stop a the other tables multiple times to chat them up or refill their water and it wasn't because the table called them over, the servers were just being nice. I went downstairs to get a refill of water at the bar and the waiter down there who was prob annoyed that I had to ask him asked me ""they don't have that upstairs?"" to which I said ""yea but they keep passing us by"".  Once I came back with my water my husband finished his and then Rapheal came and refilled his. The issue then seemed to be that he wasn't a fan of me.  The few times he came to the table he made it a point to talk to my husband, when asking the order or if the food was ok and even for cocktails it was directed at him first which just seemed a little off.   Even when I finished my cocktail he didn't come over to ask if I wanted another.  So at that point we got our food to go and left.  But like I said the food was amazing and the cocktail was delicious but the service made me fell like crap and almost like I was being discriminated against.","2 star rating"

Atmosphere/Appearance: Attached to a hotel on the main strip of Rue Rene-Levesque Ouest is this gem.  You can walk right up the decorative stairs in the outdoor seating area complete with its own bar or you can walk into the main level to sit in that dining room, the choice is yours.  We wanted to sit outside to enjoy the great weather while we still had the chance.  The decor is so beautiful.  The restaurant is so fashion-forward and modern.  It's chic design is so clean and elegant.  I loved it.  It really felt like a place the ""in crown"" would totally be caught hanging out at.

Service: Brandon was our server and I believe he was also the bartender.  He wore multiple hats and took excellent care of us.  He was personable, friendly, sweet, helpful and really allowed us to get to know him.  Good luck chasing your dreams if you're reading this dude.

Food: I started off with some Duck Wontons.  I mean, duck is just THE thing to do in Montreal, right?  Right.  They were crispy, hot and super flavorful.  The menu describes them as confit duck, button and
Shiitake mushrooms along with green onion all deep fried in
wonton wrappers then served with a plum sauce.  Delicious.  For my entree I went with the Seafood In Yellow Curry which is a concoction of shrimp, clams, calamari, scallops,long beans, cherry tomatoes, baby corn, bamboo shoots, kaffir leaves and Thai basil alll thrown together in a delicious coconut based curry sauce.  It was fantastic and I'd absolutely get it again.

Value: All prices are in $CAD.  Duck Wontons = $13.00.  Curry = $27.50.  This is a bit more of an upscale Thai restaurant so I almost expected the prices to be a bit inflated, but they weren't horrible.  Come prepared to spend some cheese because this isn't one of those hole-in-the-wall spots.

In conclusion I'm very happy my coworker recommended this place to me.  In ticked all of my boxes and made me a believer!","5 star rating"

The waiter first asked us when we sat down, if we prefer English or French? I wish I could have told her French.

We came here for MTL à table. We took the shrimp cakes as appetizers and they were ok but the vinaigrette was delicious and not too spicy. 

We took the braised pork belly and the yellow curry salmon. The curry was amazing and it complimented the rice well. The salmon was good but a but overcooked. The pork belly wad also good but not tender enough. 

For desserts, we tried both the cheesecake and the coconut chocolate bowl. The cheesecake was a bit too sweet. The coconut chocolate bowl was amazing and it looked great also.

I came here with some colleagues for a drink and dinner and the atmosphere was very inviting   The layout of the restaurant is really cool and very open. The service was very good and the staff were very friendly. 

As for the food, we shared imperial rolls, some puff pastry with chicken and we each got a meal.

The imperial rolls tasted bland even with the fish dipping sauce/oil. I didn't care for them that much. 

The puff pastry tasted really good when dipping it into their sriracha dip. However, if it wasn't for the dip, the lack of flavour would've caused me to enjoy it far less.

For my main, I got the Pad Seew. This dish was very good. However, again, the  lack of flavour really caused the dish to be not the most enjoyable. Also, some of the Chinese broccoli florets were way too big to eat with just a fork (knife was not given on the table setting).

Plus, Siam was not even on Yelp yet! (It opened January 2018.) But OpenTable included Siam's listing, and we went for it. Siam ended up being one of our favorite meals of the trip.

Our waiter - shucks, I didn't catch his name - was very friendly and attentive. He gave us a good lay of the land with the menu. He mentioned the excellent peanut sauce, which I was a little skeptical of because, I mean, who can mess up peanut sauce?

Truthfully, everything we got was excellent. And yes, the peanut sauce was better than others we have had!

The duck wontons and chicken satay were great starters to share. I was lucky enough to get two duck wontons (5 per order). 

I got the green curry as my main. The menu shows two pepper signs, which indicate the highest level of spicy. It was definitely spicy but not outrageously so. If you ever like medium spicy, this level of spicy is totally manageable. Flavors were really nice and better than your average  green curry.

Everyone else at the table really liked their dishes, too. The other dishes included Pad Thai, Ginger Chicken, Chef Panitith's crispy chicken (which our waiter described as a less breaded General Tso's - true!), Pad Mee, and Kao Cluk Ka Pi rice dish (sort of like a deconstructed and elevated fried rice). I tried a bite of each of these dishes, and they were all very good.

The final touch was that our waiter brought out taro cheesecake desserts for our birthday guests of honor with a fun sparkler. While we all agreed we likely wouldn't have ordered the cheesecake ourselves, it was truly divine! I highly recommend ordering it.

A little pricey but elegant, unique, and casual. Great meal!","5 star rating"

This place is amazing for Vegan's !!!! They have a Vegan Menu on their menu. We opted to share an order of Vegan Spring Roll which came with an amazing peanut sauce and sweet and sour sauce. 

I ordered a Vegan Pad Thai which was amazing ! My friend ordered the Vegan General Tao Chicken. I found the Vegan Pad Thai an amazing size and non greasy ! My friend loved their dish and found the sauce amazing as well. I also saw many great salads on the menu. 

The parking in the area is not the greatest. Their is however parking across the street underground. The service was prompt and amazing ! Although I find the music too loud to understand what anyone is saying and to have a conversation.

I know about this place for some time but never been here. The menu is different than a regular menu. 
We had two appetizers shrimp cake, rainbow salad. Main dishes are pork belly with lotus stem and salmon in yellow curry. Two desserts were toro cheesecake and coconut chocolate bowl. The later was creative, the chocolate bowl looks like a coconut shell. 
We like the two appetizers and curry. I did hope they offer their classic meat curry in the event menu. I am not a big fan of well-done salmon. The rainbow salad was colourful with more than ten ingredients and the green rice at the centre was a result of pandan leaves. Best salad for me. 
The portion is not big. The taste was very good, left you wanting more. The ambiance is classy. The service was good but waited a little bit long for bill and card machine.

Knew from online reviews that the food was supposed to be good but expensive. However, the food was a huge disappointment. The satay was dry and overly salty. The Tom Yum soup was sweet! I've never had sweet Tom Yum soup before and I've been to Thailand. It's supposed to be sour and spicy.  The ends of the shimejis in the Tom Yum soup were also attached. That's where all the dirt are and I usually cut that part off. Bleh. The papaya salad was soggy and unflavourful. Thailand is known for its fragrant and refreshing cuisine. I barely smelt any spices on my food. The free with purchase fried chicken wings were not bad. The breading was a bit bland but it worked well with the garlic sauce given. The total of this one person lunch came to a whopping $50. The portions were all tiny too. Definitely the most disappointing meal I had in 2021.","2 star rating"

Great food, smallish portions; though we shared quite a few dishes and it wasn't a problem. 

The peppercorn beef and duck curry in particular were very nice, and not greasy at all (which I've come to expect from low-quality duck dishes). Plenty of rice came with each dish, and when I asked to take away the little bits we had left, the waitress included more rice, which was lovely. I'm pretty sure she said it was unlimited refills on rice, as well!

The main issue is how very dark it is inside -- my mum had trouble seeing the menu in the dark, and we weren't the only ones using our phone lights to read! It's a nice ambience, for sure, but at the expense of comfort.","4 star rating"

Not cheap but it sure hit the spot. The mango is shredded with strange rice cracker things and the pad seew has a ton of beef-- tender and tasty.

I tried this place with a group of colleagues for lunch. I've been looking for a place to get a nice thai curry and i have just found it!

 This is a semi formal and spacious restaurant. The settings are nice and modern and allow one to focus on the food!

 We got different curries and a padthai. Service was polite and prompt. But the highlight was indeed the food! Everyone enjoyed their dishes; fresh, carefully prepared ingredients;  and for me tasty tasty tasty sweet and spicy coconut milk based red curry from heaven! 

Quite impressively, and this was a 1st for me, the quality of the meat in the stews was excellent. I'm used to getting medium quality meet cut to smaller pieces and scattered in thai curries. At Siam my stew came with a generous duck breast cut, placed on top of the stew, yummy crispy skin visible on top, and juicy flavorful meat hiding right under - should have taken a photo :( my colleagues had similar experiences with their food.

The curries are on the pricy side, 20-30 before tip and tax. But they do come with a serving of rice. So in consideration of my health and pocket, I'm not going back tomorrow :D but I've already added this place to my list of favs in montreal.","5 star rating"

The waiter we had was young energetic guys. Seemed to know lot about food and vine. Then we ordered the food with sampler platter for appetizers. I specifically asked the guy that we dont eat beef or pork ...so he said sure I will replace the spring roll to chicken satay. We got the platter and when I had the spring roll I had doubt looking at it  that there was some kind of meat in it. By that time my kids and husband had already had that spring roll. So I asked the waiter what kind of meat was in the roll. He said PORK. We were upset. But we said ok...poor kid he might have made mistake. So kept my mouth shut .

He did not even asked or offered to take the platter off the bill after his BiG MISTAKE. ON TOP OF IT he did not show up to bring bill. He sends a female who we didn't see before.  Then he charged extra $13 $ for that item. We paid everything without any issues. 

Since we were NOT At ALL SATISFIED WITH THE EXPERIENCE...we tipped $10. That female waitress had nerve to say you tipped too low ...u should tip 15%. What a nasty person is that waiter and waitress

Very pricey and not an especially original menu, but my duck wontons and chicken red curry were well balanced and tasty and beautifully presented. Cocktail was a highlight: gin & white port sangria with guava juice, kaffir lime, lemongrass, and basil. Light, not too sweet, paired well with the food.","5 star rating"

The setting of Siam is beautiful and classy. The food was really delicious and I had an outstanding litchi martini. The mango salad was extremely satisfying, spicy and rich in flavors. Shrimp fried rice would not deceive you, five plumb shrimp, cooked to perfection. The vegan pad thai has an amazing mix of fresh veggies, the noodles were slightly overcooked in soy sauce, but overall the dish was pretty good. Ask for the chef's special hot sauce, it is amazing and it is so hot that if I was a kid of Daenerys, flames and fire would engulf Sainte Catherine street. The service was a little bit confusing, it seems everybody in the restaurant was ready to satisfy our needs, but we had to chase the bill, at the minimum we got enough water to keep the fire down. Prices are a little bit steep, but the overall experience justifies the investment. We would be definitely back.","4 star rating"

1) attitude upon arriving with the maître d'hôtel/ manager looking down on us (party of 5) as if we could not afford the place. We were in jeans so what? 2) drinks took ages to arrive about 20 mins for 2 Diet Coke and ice teas. Only the Mojito arrived quickly but even that barely had any rhum in it.  3) One starter only after we reminded them of it being missed so about 10 Minutes after the other starters.
 4) the main courses took slightly more than an hour to arrive. I eat a lot of Thai food across the world and Thailand so generally know my Thai food quite well - from experience know that what we ordered never take this long to prepare. 5) food was nothing special. 6) I tipped very little to show my dissatisfaction and was told you did not appreciate the service to which I said I did not and there was not even an acknowledgement or an attempt to apologize.  

Definitely do not recommend this restaurant.","2 star rating"

The menu was a little bit disappointing (lack of variety - they don't have Thai desserts and no Thai Ice Tea *gasp*). But our waiter was very friendly and most of the food were delish (definitely try the beef). The spring roll was so-so, should have ordered the Imperial Rolls (deep-fried) and the Tom Yum lacked spiciness (maybe because Canadian doesn't like spicy food?). But will definitely come back when we're craving Thai food.","4 star rating"

The cocktails here are interesting and FANTASTIC but the food is disappointing as some dishes are very tasty while others are bland and some are unacceptable. The appetizer tasting platter was good and included duck wontons which were very good; the mango salad was tasty while the papaya salad was extremely bland; the Seafood Tom Kah Soup was so bad that it left me wondering if the person who prepared it had any knowledge of Thai flavours or had ever tasted this soup as it's supposed to be prepared: It arrived at the table with almost no creaminess to it, the kitchen then sent out an extremely tiny container of something that was supposed to be coconut milk but which was so thin and watery that if it was coconut milk then it would have been diluted to the nth degree and did nothing to improve the dishwater flavour of the soup. The liquid itself was extremely sour yet devoid of any other flavour, just awful, inedible; the Confit Duck in Red Curry was tasty but extremely sweet; the Beef in Green Curry was excellent. I'll return to this restaurant to have more of the wonderful cocktails and appetizers but my experience with that ""soup"" and the bland papaya salad, two very common Thai dishes, makes me wary to try other dishes.","3 star rating"

It is close to the Bell centre.  That's it. The chicken curry was like a soup in which a few tiny parts of chicken and tiny bits of eggplant and beans were floating... Overpriced and way below par.  Go elsewhere!","1 star rating"

Siam puts a new spin on thai. We had the spring rolls and papaya salad and the panang beef and garlic tofu. My boyfriend who doesn't usually like tofu said it was the best he ever had and loved it. The beef was braised and so delicious. We finished with the creme brulee which had such a great kaffir lime leaf flavor. We were there during happy hour so drinks and appetizers were cheaper. 5 dollar glasses of wine and 6 dollar draft beers. Keep in mind the appetizers are smaller. Our server was amazing. He was funny, charming and knowledgeable. Also a great place if you have food allergies. I have a gluten intolerance and he came back with a whole chart on what I can and can't eat from the menu. They have it for peanuts, dairy and shellfish as well. This put me at ease and helped me have an amazing dining expirience.  I fully recommend and we will be back next time we are in town!","5 star rating"
