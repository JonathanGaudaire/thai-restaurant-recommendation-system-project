One of my favorite beef noodles soup places. Come on a weekend to try the braised beef noodles. Did not disappoint
They make the noodles fresh but so-so for flavor. We ordered the special spicy beef noodles soup and spicy noodles with pork. We preferred the spicy beef noodles soup. It was rather expensive $30 for 2 bowls of noodles soup and a diet coke in Chinatown. Customer service is non existence so don't expect any - we asked for our diet coke 4x after my husband tried to get it out of the locked fridge by himself!
"noodles soup is only ok; we are not impressed. Waiter is neither friendly nor professional. And our beef noodles soup comes with a slice of pork!?"
We waited for about 40 min to get a table and it was worth it! We got beef noodles soup ( thin noodles) and dan dan noodles (thick noodles). Beef noodles soup was out of this world. The thick noodles on the second dish was hard and felt undercooked. Waitress told us that is normal for thick noodles( although it would make sense to cook a few minutes more). She was kind enough to exchange the dish with thinner noodless for no extra charge. Thinner noodles wasn't as soft as the noodles in the soup but interestingly got softer due to its own heat. Portion was good.
Delicious noodles shop with someone hand pulling noodless at the front! Delighted to find delicious Chinese noodless in Montreal which did not disappoint. Loved their lanzhou beef noodles soup - the rest of the group got the braised beef tendon dan dan mian and spicy beef tendon soup. All delicious pretty fair prices decent service. Would recommend if in the area!
"I'm giving it 3/5 for the overall taste. I had that house soup and this is my breakdown:

Pros:
Fresh al dente noodless
Considerable amount of meat
Generation portion of noodles and soup

Cons:
Overlly salty soup base drawning the flavour (kidney hurting saltiness )

I had tried fair amount of noodles places in various cities and I'm sad to inform you Yelpers that is not the ""best beef noodles place"" around. Adding tons of salt on your beef broth doesn't mean it will be the most savoury and tasty soup ever!!!"
"You have three choices: beef noodles soup veggie noodles soup and zhajiang mian (dry noodless with veggies bean curd paste and meat). I had the beef noodles soup and my wife had the zhajiang mian. Both were really good. The cucumber appetizer was excellent - the oil was spicy and the peanuts made a great contrast. 

Equal to any noodless we had during our five years in China. Highly recommended."
Food here is insane! The noodles soup beef are all super authentic and tasty. I haven't had such authentic Lan Zhou Handmade noodles for decade. Very happy here.
I was craving soup and found this place while walking through Chinatown. It gets very crowed because the space is small and cramped. We were seated almost immediately but we had to share a table with another couple. I ordered the medium spicy beef noodles soup with jo ye noodless and my husband got the non-spicy beef noodles soup. The medium is huge but that didn't stop me from eating it all. Service was quick and you pay on your way out. Definitely worth a visit!
"hand made noodless. fast. great service. open kitchen. Need i to say more?

There was a line up when we got there but it moves pretty fast (approximately 10 mins wait). As soon as the server sees you there waiting he offers you a glass of water.

Staff is extremely friendly and nice. Service is really fast. Even faster when you speak chinese to them.

My boyfriend and I had ordered the soup dumplings sweet and sour veggie pork noodles and a beef noodles. The soup dumplings were good as they are made on the spot. The veggie pork handmade noodles was really good. The beef noodles not so much.

They are definitely known more for their handmade noodless. 

Will be returning the next time I'm in town to try the spicy noodles and shanghai noodles everyone is raving about!"
The noodles soup is very tasty and the service is good.  We have a party of three people and we all enjoyed the noodles soup very much.  We all definitely return.
As a food court standard food is decent. I had the beef shank soup. It's a typical Taiwanese noble soup. The beef is tender and tasty. Soup base is good as well. The best part is that their noodles are hand made right on the spot.
This is a rare find noodles house situated in montreal chinatown. They only offer 3 types of noodles soups on their menu with the most popular choice being the lanzhou lamian. It is a very traditional bowl of rich clear beef broth with a mix of cilantro beef flanks and white radish. noodless are hand-pulled. You can choose the noodles thickness as well as spiciness. Overall its a very flavorful noodles bowel. No msg. Great value. Quick service.
I just order one soup for take out....it's over priceand the beef was not fresh...and the soup taste nothing....I think I like Vietnamese pho more than Lanzhou noodles..sorry...
"Get the chef's recommended braised beef tendon noodles! I was able to try this as well as the Lan Zhou special beef noodles and so I strongly recommend the braised beef noodles! 

You ought to order the thick noodles strands. They offer many options of size/kind of noodless so pick wisely as it could influence your overall impression/experience.

It's a relatively small shop that attracts more than its fair share. Crowds and lines are common."
Looking for a Taiwanese noodles staple especially during the winter season this hit the spot for us. Super small  establishment but still fit at least 30ish or so. Lan zhao beef noodles soup and Dan Dan noodles were the picks for dinner plus a couple side boiled tea eggs. noodless were perfectly cooked for both dishes. LAN zhao soup was delightful as well.
I would love to tell you what I ordered but I have zero clue.  Some spicy noodles soup beef soup.  It was excellent.  Service was very rushed.  Washroom requires steps elevator walking through a grocery store and a code on the door.  I was very happy when I finally got there.  Would come back for sure.  I give it three Aruns.
The classic beef noodles soup is alright but the zhajiangmian is really greasy and flavorless. Love their potato and beans salad
"Try if you've never been but if you've had beef noodles soup from Asia before this place isn't worth a second visit.

MSG soup! Maybe it's my hyper sensitivity to MSG but I was thirsty for at least two hours after having their signature beef noodless. 

I ordered the thick noodless. noodless were a bit undercooked and lacked elastic texture that you'd expect from handmade Chinese noodless. The beef was a bit dry.

The soup base is not made from beef; it tastes like a concentrate based stock flavored with lots of MSG and pepper oil. I'd expect something like this from a street vendor in China except this was 10x the cost."
"The noodles soup here is legit.  

Broth is delicious.  Well seasoned not overly salty. You can ask them for non-spicy or mildly spicy broth.  

noodless were amazing!  Had a good chew and texture.  I tried two types- flat and round- and both were well prepared and cooked.

Great portions.  I got the beef tendon noodles soup for around $12 or $13.  Got a really good amount of beef and beef tendon. It would be the perfect dish to share (tho I'm not sure if they'd allow two people to eat one bowl).  

Highly recommended! Wish this place was in Manhattan."
"Dear fellow food lovers 

I totally agree with you guys this place is really good and they are VERY generous on their portions. I took the combo with the beef noodles soup. The soup was good with fresh noodless & ingredients. Served quickly. Definitely one of the best soup noodles places in Montreal.  The place is small so during peak hours it will be full. 

Until the next meal... salutation"
The bouillon of beef noodles soup is not that hot to cook the rare beef and they are dirty how's the hell they gave a plate of bean sprout and Thai Basil for 3 people it's supposed one for each crispy noodles is too salty for the sautee. I never come back at this place anymore
"Very genuine Lanzhou noodles. Lanzhou hand-pulled noodless (???? lan zhou la mian). It is a registered commercial designation and a long list of rules and standards to defines it. I heard an authentic dish must include ""one clear (soup) two white (radish) three red (chili oil) four green (parsley) and five yellow (noodles)."" 

This small restaurant is always crowded. The seating is not very comfortable. 
I always order a combo which include a noodles soup a salad and a tea-infused egg. The various sickness of the noodles really makes the noodles so different from another. I always ask for chilli oil. Sometimes I add some black vinegar in the halfway too and it would make the soup more refreshing."
"If you love hand drawn noodless and are very hungry you will love this place. 

The portions are large and they specialize in beef noodles soup beef tendon noodles soup with a wide variety of noodles options from extremely thin to wide. All of their noodless are hand made right out front.

Highlights:
- Medium is big enough for normal people. You are competing in a food challenge if you order a Large bowl.
- Seating is limitied with around 10 tables and 40 seats total. I would avoid coming during the lunch or dinner rush.
- Located in the small Chinatown section of Montreal
- Prices are about $10-$12 Canadian per bowl
- Service is very quick.
- Asian Grocery story on the bottom floor!"
Quick and fast service. The noodless and the soup wasn't too heavy and it was goo especially when we were craving a soup noodles dish. I got tea egg on the side it was good but not amazing.
"I was looking for a place that would take credit cards and I came across this place.  I ordered their beef stew noodles soup and it was nothing like the normal beef noodles soup you get at chinese restaurants.  It wasn't that bad but it wasn't that great either.  It wasn't that flavorful. 

However it was cheap ($7.10 canadian) for the noodles soup.

But what I really dislike was that the staff was rude.  The woman who took my order was impatient and was annoyed at anything I said.  So I never want to go back!"
"I don't normally love plain beef soup but I cannot argue with how delicious the broth and home made noodless are.  I also can't argue with the $7.99 price tag for a small (hint - it ain't so small) red noodles soup.  

Yummmmmmm.  A little wait but damn good"
Decent environment as a pho place. I ordered a large pho soup. The soup tastes just right but I think the portion of noodles was less than what I expected.
Super delicious soup . I order the medium size and it was huge !!! Fast  good service
Favorite noodles resto -- tiny menu / consistently fast delicious affordable food / good service / chill ambiance
"Went here on Valentines for lunch after the spa. I had the small veggie noodles soup and my fiancé had a medium beef noodles soup(spicy). The portions are very big.
I love how you can see the fresh hand pulled noodless being made while you're waiting. 
The food? Sooo yummy! Loved my veggie noodles soup the only thing I would change is to not add the seaweed salad. The noodless themselves were very good.
My fiancé had lots to say about his spicy beef noodles soup. He said multiple times how ""amazing"" it was. And that he would rate 5/5. The next day I flew home and he went back to this restaurant alone to get the same thing because he loved it that much and said he will come back every time he comes back to Montreal."
"We came here on a late Sunday on our way to Quebec City. The place is small but we didn't wait long for seats. Service was fast and we received our order within minutes. 

I ordered the vegetable noodles soup (not combo) and my boyfriend ordered the traditional beef noodles soup (combo). He wanted to add beef tendon to his order but it was all sold out. His combo came with a choice of side dish. We decided to go with the potato seaweed salad. That side dish was a huge portion for one person. 

Despite this being a noodles place the noodless that I got were a bit overdone. I'd prefer al dente. I do have to say that the portions are quite big."
Nice and authentic Chinese noodles boutique. You have a variety of choices on noodles and the meat and the soup are all carefully prepared.
Got to the restaurant five mins before opening and there was already one person waiting in line. Soon after three groups joined the line behind us. We all had to wait 15 mins for them to fix a machine which none of us seemed to mind. We were seated and chose our dishes. My party chose the beef noodles soup (spicy and non spicy) as well as another noodles dish with edamame minced pork and other veggies. I've never had beef noodles soup but I feel as though the broth was not as flavorful as I imagined. To me it tasted watered down. The noodless and beef were nice. I like that we got to choose our noodles thickness. My group got a mix of sizes 1 2 5 and 6. The service here was really good and the servers were super nice! The prices were great but I don't think that I would come back.
Terrible service in a very small space. Food is okay although soup tastes like hotpot base.
Great food. Good service. Very talkative but very prompt and courteous server. Spicy fried calamari mangolian beef garlic shrimps clams in oyster sauce madarin beef are my favourite dishes there.
"Slowly the complex flavors of a generous sized bowl of Pho Dac Biet unfurl like the petals of the lotus flower in this new family-owned establishment! The beef seasoned broth served along rice noodless thinly sliced beef meatballs tendon is authentic and close to what you would expect from a homemade concoction - easy on the cloves and lean on the fat content.

You will also find your staple choices of egg noodles with bbq pork and shrimp soup various rice or rice vermicelli dishes with grilled chicken pork beef and the famous vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk. 

Recently inspired from my foodie friend's posting I was intrigued and had to stop and try it out. Although only officially inaugurated two weeks ago owners Son & Thao are working out the usual minor opening related kinks but this seems to be a promising outlet for soups & noodles cravings!

Definitely must return to try ""off-menu"" items such as Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef and thick noodles soup) or Bun Rieu  (crab and noodles soup). What surprises do the friendly Sen Vang (Golen Lotus) owners Son and Thao await us on our next visit?Come and find out for yourself!"
If you love authentic quality a bowl of chicken noodles Pho soup this is a must to come to this restaurent. I ordered a chicken salad Vietnamese egg rolls and a nice bowl of hot noodles soup it was soooo good and tasty. You can tell they don't put MSG. I also love their Vietnamese ice coffee and 3 colour coconuts drink. The service is ok. The owner is friendly. Recommended!!
Saw some reviews here and went to try the beef shank noodles soup then. well...good part is they made fresh noodles in front of customers and the cooking time was very quick. but... not really satisfied for the portion and the taste.
"A must try in Montreal! 

We wanted to try this place due to the high reviews and ratings we saw. The menu is very simple - they only have 4 noodles choices consists of Zhajiang noodles Dan Dan noodles beef noodles soup and vegetarian noodles soup. You can also order side appetizers. They make their hand pulled noodless fresh in the front where everyone can see the process. It's so therapeutic to watch. You can pick between different levels of thickness for your noodless. 

We ordered the Dan Dan noodles. I would say to pick a thickness somewhere between the middle for dry noodless. We also got beef shank cold appetizer spicy cucumber and seaweed potato salad. Everything was so good. I love starting with cold appetizer to stimulate your appetite. The Dan Dan noodles was the best I've had. The noodles was made to perfection and the sauce was so flavorful. We ordered a size medium and that was enough to shared amongst two people. The tea leaf egg included in the noodles was also very tasty. 

I don't think they take reservations. We went around 1-2pm on a weekday and waited about 30-45 minutes to get seated. It is definitely worth the wait!"
"Delicious well-made hand-pulled noodless.  Soup was flavorful (a bit over salted IMHO). 

Can see chef hand making noodless throughout the day. 

Special beef noodles soup available Friday Saturday and Sunday.

We ate here twice during our 4-day visit to Montreal!  

Restaurant was an easy 5 to 10 mins walk from Notre Dame."
As good as Lanzhou noodles gets!! Great price and fast service. I will definitely come back!
"They hype is real!! Believe it!!!

Serves one of the best beef noodles soups in all of Montreal! 

They're not stingy with the beef! The beef chunks are tender but soo flavorful. The beef flavor is incredibly rich and savory and it's not too oily. This is the true star of the restaurant!

You have a choice of size for noodless - we chose thick. noodless were plentiful AND FLAVORFUL !

**Advice:
*portions are very large!*
*If you have a high spicy/heat tolerance then the spicy sauce on the table will be weak for you. Ask for the legit hot hot sauce from the kitchen. 1 drop will burn your mouth!***  
*Order the Beef noodles soup*

We also ordered the Vegetable soup . Very light in flavor but would not order again. 

 Highly Recommend!"
"Huge bowls of fresh noodless with tasty broth what more could you ask for? 

This place is perpetually crowded but thankfully they've expanded seating into the restaurant next door so they can seat more than a few tables. It's situated about the asian grocery store that I go to so sometimes waiting near the entrance is a bit hectic with the in and out + the people standing by the window watching the noodles pulling masters at work. 

It's great that you can get whatever shape/size noodles you want since they're made completely fresh. The standard beef noodles soup is very tasty and made with thin slices of beef. The large is quite large and should be able to satisfy any noodles soup appetite.  I also love the tendon beef noodless as the meat is a bit more thick and tender . Tea egg and spicy cucumber salad are my favorite sides. 

I'm glad they're doing delivery/takeout and I'll be glad to eat in person when they can reopen. noodles soups are a must for a winter that lasts 5 months!"
Amazing food great soup and chai tea . Fun atmosphere and good service! Salads are very generous!!
I ordered a mixed vegetable noodles soup. It's too sweet and oily to me..plus the bowl is broken...omg..
Cramped little spot. Expect to wait. Great noodles and soup. Portions are big. Pricing also worth for portion.
I ordered the braised beef tendon noodles soup a special served only on friday through sunday. The portion was very generous the broth had an amazing depth to it the beef was perfect and the noodless had a great al dente feel to it unbelievable!
Good vibe super sangria! Prices reasonable service well OK we will try again with food. Soup looked fantastic-
"Authentic affordable Cantonese food. Their lunch menu is also tasty and of good value; congee (particularly century egg & pork and ten tsai jook) and beef tendon noodles soup (au gan tong mein) are personal favourites."
"Beware of the large portion! 

Took a small bowl of lanzhou beef noodles and couldn't finish. The noodles of a good chewy texture but the soup lack a bit of flavor.

The side dish of seaweed and potato was excellent!"
"Good addictive & inexpensive Chinese Beef noodles soup.

TASTE :
This Beef noodles Soup is different from Japanese Ramen. This is more light & spicy I would say. If you like Asian noodless you'd better try it to enlarge your taste. It worth it.

I never tried Chinese noodles in China so I don't know the original taste of Chinese Ramen but this is one of the most delicious Ramen in Montreal. Much better than other Japanese Ramens with fake tacky instant taste.

ORDER TIP :
You can choose the shape of noodles(5~6) & it varies final outcome. You can also choose it to be spicy or not.

(If it is your first time & you don't fancy coriander ask them not to put it because they put a lot then you'd expect.)"
Expect big bowls of Beef noodles Soup and line ups here! This tiny stall only has 10 tables and some counter style seating. Their specialty is Szechwan style hand pulled noodless. You can watch the Master make strands of fresh noodless in just seconds. Just a few options on the menu. You choose beef brisket or thinly sliced beef shank your size of noodless and if you would love like your soup base spicy or non-spicy. The soup is flavourful & aromatic with chilli oil green onions and hint of Cumin & Five Spice. The noodless have great texture and the perfect bounce. Can't go wrong with a bowl of noodless here.
"Good noodless especially beef noodless; abhorrent service on the other hand but food is worth coming for"
"Big lines to get into the small noodles soup place. Everything was delicious and served quickly. Prices were reasonable. 
noodles soups were very flavourable and generous size. Stick with a medium bowl unless you are very hungry."
Cute little noodles place... cool how you can watch them make noodless.  The noodles soup was ehh.. I think the name over hyped the food. Good place to try at least once especially for tourist.
"I found Nu-Do after reading Jennifer K's review list of restaurants to try in Montreal (yelp.ca/list/a-weekend-i…). After a long day of shopping I decided to give it a try. Normally food court food will be frozen and heated up or fast food that is filled with calories. Not with Nu-do. Each dish uses hand made noodless that is made fresh to order. 

During my visit I ordered the noodles soup with chicken and my brother ordered the noodles soup with beef. The noodles soup with chicken tasted amazing. The noodless had a nice texture and were cooked amazingly. The broth also tasted delicious as it was filled with flavour. My brother said that the noodles soup with beef tasted awesome and the noodless were the best part of the dish. 

Nu-do exceeded my expectations. The fresh noodless and tasty broth is not something found in a food court. I recommend this to everyone looking for food to eat after shopping. It earned all of its five stars."
"This pho place was amazing!!! BEST in town! The soup was extremely tasty I think they also added chicken broth along with beef soup. It was soooo good! 
We also got the beef salad it was quite special. Kind of like beef tartar but got a Vietnamese spin to it with loads of peanuts and fresh herbs. Great!
They also give you a small bowl along with your soup it's for you to miss the sauces and dip your pho in there for some added flavour.
It was such a satisfying lunch!"
pretty good hand strung noodles with good broth the service is pretty fast during lunch time too. they have different thickness of noodles that you can choose from and they also have a variety of appetizers
I found out later that there are way better options just one block west of here.  had a raw beef soup and the beef was hard and chewy.  not fresh ingredients.  the place was empty and depressing.
I had the cold noodles bowl but also tasted the beef noodles soup and the cucumber dish. Liked all of them. The noodles is the best of all the ingredients. The sliced beef is only okay to me. I wish they were stewed beef chucks. At the catchier you may be asked whether you would include tips in the check. You'd want to tell the waiter/waitress the amount of tip you wish to give to avoid a surprise that you may not accustomed to.
I had the classic beef noodles soup with medium-sized round noodless and it was pretty good. It's pretty packed in there at lunch and the tables are small but that actually seems like a pretty appropriate atmosphere.
"3.5 Star

I love noodless and especially Freshly Hand Pulled noodles made to order so this review will be bias.

A steamy bowl of tasty noodles soup will make me a happy camper especially after a beer or two.. a perfect drunk food. 

This is also one of the first time I have to say I love Food Court ""Fast' food! 

Spicy Beef Shank noodles ($8.50) was really good but a little pricey and smaller in portion compares to Chinatown location. 

A good option if you are in the area and have cravings for Chinese food."
For only 9 Canadian dollar the lanzhou noodles was amazing! There were more than enough beef and the soup was light but flavorful. The beef meaty taste mixed with fresh cilantro an not salty at all. The noodless were all hand made and very chewy. Definitely recommend the wide noodless! Would come here many times!!
I had the beef tender ramen the broth is really good loved it! The portion of beef tender was generous as well. I asked for the wide noodles but it was too soft and got softer overtime in the soup. My husband ordered vegi ramen the soup was very buttery. It didn't taste Chinese to me... The regular broth is much better in my mind. He had the regular narrow noodles we both liked it better than the wide one.
Wow so delicious. I had a small bowl of beef and vegetables with noodless medium spicy. Beef was ground beef sauce had lots of peanuts herbs not much broth. Hubby had the beef tendon soup with noodless also medium spicy. Baby bok choy in both. His broth was do wonderfully beefy and flavorful that this must be one of the recipes where the beef tendons are cooked for hours. Anthony Bourdain would love this place. noodless are all made and hand-pulled on site. My small bowl was $8.99 hubby's large was $10.99. Cheap amazing food well worth waiting for. On a very cold Friday at 1:30 we only waited about 10 minutes.
"They only have 1 choice of soup and it is excellent Lan Zhou style beef noodles soup.  You can ask them for no spice if you don't like spicy food the base beef stock is still flavorful without extra spice.  Though try adding a little spice to your threshold level (maybe for your last few bites) for a more complete experience. They also offer a customer's choice for noodles type/thickness.  My personal favorite is the ultra-thin noodles because they're soft and absorb the soup so well.  Though you can also go for big inches-wide chewy flat noodles and anything in between.  

The portion is larger than you'd normally see in Montreal.  Their small is most people's normal size so get small for solo or get a medium/large to share.  If you always complain that other places don't give enough you're going to leave happy from here.  It's worth the wait if the line doesn't go beyond the entrance.  Price quality quantity are all on-point.

Is it as good as eating it in Lan Zho China?  No.  But this is plenty good enough to have a taste in Montreal."
Despite the long wait to get in and  the long wait to get our noodless the food did not disappoint!  Their beef noodles soup is the best that I have tried!
"Probably one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Brossard. The spicy beef soup is excellent don't be fooled by the ""spicy"" as it's really not spicy at all. Quick service and friendly waiters perfect for a cold winter day!"
Absolutely delicious!! The tonkinoise soup of rare beef was delicious as was the special soup. The chicken soup was full of veggies noodless and the most tender chicken. The grilled pork chop smelled amazing coming off a wood fire grill. It was tender and tasty and delicious! The portions are large and the service friendly! A must try!
Got the broth with braised beef.  Was skeptical at first since we r in a food court.  Saw the guy grab pasta dough and start making enough pasta for my soup to order.  That was pretty cool to watch.  Bowl was very flavorful and certainly exceeded my expectations.  Great value and flavors in a food court  - can't go wrong if you like Taiwanese noodles soup.
"Gi gà (chicken salad) and Ph gà (chicken noodles soup) are the ""must try"" items. Hands down! Good service and relatively cleaner than most restaurants as well. I will definitely be back to try different dishes that they offer on our next Montreal trip."
"Huge huge huge portions. Seriously get the small if you have a size choice unless you want leftovers for the next day. I had the beef tendon noodles soup which only comes in medium and certainly served as my lunch and dinner that day. The tendon was cooked well and not too chewy. The broth was flavourful and reminded me of the dark Taiwanese beef noodles soup broth. The noodless were perfectly al dente and chewy as advertised by the guy kneading away by the window. 

My boyfriend got the dandan noodless. While this dish was very delicious it's also extremely oily! Beware if you have a sensitive stomach. In addition they use copious amounts of peppercorn so be prepared for that numbing-spicy feeling in your mouth. 

All in all a pleasant efficient meal for a great price. Also don't expect a Micheline 3-star restaurant service; Asian countries have a different mentality towards service. You come to a place like this for the food not the service -- keep that in mind when you see the poorer reviews!"
"Delicious! They have a small menu and the beef tendon noodles soup is only available on weekends. I got a small beef noodles and my boyfriend got a large- the size difference is ridiculous! They're very generous in their portions and small was definitely more than enough for me. The noodless are great chewy. I got the ""two xi"" size which I think is prefect; boyfriend got the ""three xi"" and it was a bit too thick. Highly recommended!!"
It's the worst noodles I have ever had. The noodles quality is bad and the noodles style is depends on the person. Bad skill. And the most of the noodles are not boiled well. Kind of disgusting. not recommend at all!!!!!!!
Good pho! We ordered the beef ball one after finishing one dinner and the soup is good.
"Since I had not such a good experience on my first visit I decided to give this place a second visit.

I decided to try their signature dish....the Lan Zhou beef noodles soup.

What a great choice...it was delicious...I ordered it medium and it was a bit spicy for me...and I eat spicy...

The noodless (I picked #2) were nice and moist yummy and thick....the beef slices are thin almost like leaves of a tree...but tasty and delicious.

Every time I've been...there's a line so plan accordingly.   

Get the Lan Zhou soup !!!!!!!!!!!!"
A must try hand pulled noodles joint in the heart of Montreal's Chinatown. The special beef noodless were to die for and the service was prompt. Absolutely worth the 20 minutes we waited in line. Don't miss this place!
This is by far the best beef noodles soup restaurant I ever had. We came here because of the crowds and long waiting line while visiting Old Montreal. We thought it must be good. No surprise it was very good. The restaurant is very small and table sitting is very limited. Sometimes you might have to share table with others. So if you don't like the cramped sitting and space you will not like here. Now for the food the beef noodles soup was excellent. Not only it tasted great it was huge in portion. You need a big appetite to finish it.
"Had it as our first meal in Montreal. The queue was very long and we were there around 3pm (not really a lunch hour rush) and waited for at least 30 to 40 mins. 
The noodles was good. I had the number 1 combo Spicy Beef noodles + Cucumber salad. noodles was chewy and the salad was refreshing."
"This place blows NYC Vietnamese food out of the water. Why pho can't have a renaissance here like ramen did I'll never know.

Came here on a Sunday morning for a noodles breakfast. Planned on ordering pho but decided to switch to bun bo hue at the last minute. I like to live life on the edge what can I say? Soup was fantastically spicy and flavorful noodless were on point (none of that rice noodles BS) and there was plenty of beef. I'm pretty sure the waitstaff was talking about me but I was in soup noodles bliss and just couldn't bring myself to care. Now bring this to New York and I'll be a happy camper...

Until next time Montreal."
Typical Chinatown atmosphere. Excellent and friendly service. Reliable food. A family favourite. Willing to adapt the menu if you have dietary issues. Our favourites: General Tao chicken chow mein orange chicken Beef Chow Ho stir fried snow pea leaves vegetarian hot and sour soup.. Large portions. Great value.
"Authentic LAN ZHOU beef noodless.
?.???"
"Friendly staff and great Vietnamese food! If you're looking for a great Pho restaurant on the South Shore look no further!

If you like beef Pho and feel adventurous enough to try something other than your Pho Dac Biet try their Beef Stew Soup (#8). Really really good if you love well cooked beef and tendons. 

Coming back for sure!"
Eh....just ordered special noodles soup to go...got back to my hotel and found soup and no noodless... I guess they think I need to go on a diet... no carbs for you tonight! :( Better check your order before you leave :)
This restaurant never disappoints! A BYOW with delicious dishes. What more can you ask for? I would definately recommend their Loc Lac Beef  beef papaya salad and their seafood soup. The service is pretty quick. Friday and Saturday nights can be quite busy but the restaurant is quite spacious.  This restaurant is one of the best asian restaurants in the east end. A MUST TRY!
"Bustling tasty Lanzhou hand-pulled noodles place in Montreal Chinatown. There was a line when we got there for Saturday lunch but it moved quickly. The staff was pleasant but busy.

My wife had the special which was a beef noodles soup. I had dan dan mian. Both were delicious. As a heads up the dan dan mian did not come in a soup (the way I've typically had it in NYC). Unexpected for me maybe it's common but it was very good."
Ordered for delivery even though it's a bit farther from my house than I would usually order so it was a bit of a wait but well worth it in the end. I got rare beef soup beef skewers and the chicken imperial rolls. Everything was delicious!
Yummy noodles Soups. I got the medium soup think it was decent sized but it was HUGE! So yummy though!
At 10:30pm on a chilly evening I wanted steaming hot Asian food. I ordered a wonton noodles soup and it was exactly what I wanted- flavorful savory broth noodless and wontons. Service was very attentive one of the best servers we've had during our time in Montreal! This place hit the spot.
Great service ! Tiny place but they accommodated all 9 of us! And delicious food! The chicken soup was amazing and warming for such a cold day!
Dan Dan noodles is the best chinese noodles dish I've ever eaten. Must have! Must recommend! Must go eat Dan Dan noodless. Also great edamame. The place is small and basic but who cares where you're eating the best noodles when you're eating the best noodles?
Great place to stop by on a cold day. The soup is savory and delicious. Excellent service. Would come back the next time I visit Montreal!
"Worst experience worst service of woman ""manager"" with black glasses. If you want bad service and normal food go to this restaurant!!"
If you're looking for fresh made authentic hand pulled noodless you need to come here. You can choose your noodles size and type of soup-I had the beef broth. You also choose bowl size. I had medium which was pushing my limits. If you have a brontosaurus appetite go with large. Small restaurant with about a dozen tables. The place also serves as an entrance to an underground market. If the lines are long you can sit at counter where 3 seats exist. Good food and service. Watch the noodles pulling before sitting down to eat. Enjoy!
"best chinese restaurant in chinatown if you know what to order!
best hong kong style dishes in mtl!!! so if you are ordering won ton soupsweet and sour soupgeneral taobeef and brocolithen go somewhere else cause u don't know chinese food"
"Excellent noodles soup.  First class broth.  Full meal in a small soup for about $10.00 at time of review.
Choice of homemade noodles.
Cozy.   Be prepared to share table.
Real street eats.
Limited menu.
Recomended.
Went back for small soup as usual.  Kitchen error they made a large. 
Size of a small hub cap.
 No problem just charged for small.  But I was sitting alone at the very front.  Everyone  walking by looked at the size then looked at me in disgust.  Finally with one woman I said I ordered the small.  She gasped that's a small!!
Yes I said.
Lol."
"Arrived at Montreal late in the day. Found this place while browsing & yelping decided to give it a try. 

The line was out the door when we arrived at the restaurant. Decided to get take outs & bring back to the hotel. Ordered the medium beef noodless & the special beef tendon noodless (limited Availability on Friday - Sunday)

The noodless are really chewy actually have a bounce when biting into it. The kids love it. The beef tendons are pretty good too.

The beef from the beef noodles soup were not seasoned it was pretty bland until eaten with the tendon spicy soup base. And the soups itself are quite salty. 

The restaurant does not seem to have AC it was quite stuffy & hot was sweating while waiting for order."
The impressive ancient art of hand making the noodless from dough is at full display in the front window. Combo of soup vegetable side Is for newbies and tourists but just soup Is the way to go. If you want something extra go for extra beef. Only order large soup If you have a huge appetite. For Most medium Is more than enough food.
"HUGE portions of noodless. My family got 5 of the medium beef special noodles soups and they were gigantic. If you have a big appetite you may be able to finish a medium however. 

noodless are made on the spot and definitely taste fresh. The noodles sizes listed on the menu are bigger/thicker than they seem. 

Also make sure to put in the hot chili oil in your soup!!!"
"The noodless come in large portions. The medium can feed two. The beef noodles was delicious. The noodles was right texture the soup was full of flavor. The special also comes with a side. The cucumber salad was also very good.

This is a fast and cheap eat. Would come back again."
Some things are delicious others not bad at this tiny friendly hole in the wall in Chinatown. First and foremost though the staff are super nice here. Everyone always seems happy and well fed. A solid lunch spot with big portions and yummy classics like the peanut dumplings imperial rolls but I'd say avoid the noodles soups. For me at least on a recent trip the noodless were a bit soggy and the noodles to soup ratio was out of control. noodles overload at the noodles factory. I'll be back though it's one of those places.
"After a bit of a wait we were seated and I must say they were very efficient.  They got our table ready and service was very prompt.  I think thats about how good they got.  The food was a whole different story.

If I were to break a part the meal down some part were good and the other parts absolutely needs work on.  We had lobster congee and a bowl of noodles soup.  The lobster was great!  It was sweet and didn't taste fishy and the congee part tasted bland.

The noodles soup.  The noodless were great the soup base was salty the meat was cooked til it was tough and there were hardly any veggies in the noodles soup.  

This place is packed with tourist and locals compared to the other chinese restaurants that I walked passed.  Overall it was ok but I've tasted better."
The service was friendly and the place is cute. The food? Not so much. Their ramen version taste anything but ramen. Also I'm not a fan of grounded meat in my soup although the soup base was quite interesting tasted more like a spicy coconut laksa.
Very good beef salad and sticky rice. I tend to order those two the most and of course together. Their beef with white wine sauce is very good too. My boyfriend loves their curry. I think it's pretty good but I just don't like curry. Service is fast and sometimes friendly. But Iits not an expensive resto so I don't expect fancy service. I care a lot more abou the food and I think this place is great.
No trip to Montreal is ever complete without a stop at my favourite hand pulled noodles soup restaurant. Nouilles de Alan Zhou delivers consistent every time I come- delicious broth perfectly cooked noodless and just the right amount of heat (spicy AF)- their soup makes my heart sing and my tummy very very happy.
Cash/debit only. The noodles is sooooooooo soft. I chose the small noodles size. A medium bowl of noodles can feed 2 women. So be careful! They don't seem to have beverages choice but you can go downstairs to the Asian supermarket to get yourself a coco drink.
"[Montreal Food Tour Stop #7] A small hole-in-the-wall restaurant with Cantonese noodless.  The restaurant has an open kitchen and serves a variety of stir fry and tasty noodles dishes.  Not a lot of tables so probably not great for a huge group but a decent sized place to bring your family. Portion size is good for the price.  No credit cards are accepted but taxes are included in the price.

Highlights: I ordered the beef chow ho fun which is one of my favorite noodles dishes ($9.95 CAD tax included).  The dish has beef green onions flat rice noodless cut into bite size pieces and bean sprouts.  This dish tends to be greasy but I was happy that my order from here was not too greasy.  There was a decent amount of beef.  The server politely served me water even though I was ordering takeout.  Flavor profile was very good.

Critiques: None really.  Beef rice noodless aren't a fancy dish so what I ate pretty much met my expectations.

Overall: noodles Factory satisfied my noodles craving.  The dish I ordered was flavorful not excessively greasy and had a decent mix of ingredients that weren't noodless.  Plus you get good value for the price."
Tried the beef chow fun hand-pulled noodles soup and peanut sauce pork dumplings. Was directed here by the good reviews so was expecting too much I guess. Really wasn't impressed by the food. Might try other dishes one day but didn't stand up to our expectations. The noodless in the soup were soggy and overcooked even before the broth cooked them more. The dumplings were too sweet-- tasted like peanut butter and honey on wontons.. very strange. The beef chow fun tasted more like a pad sew that you'd get at thai express. Disappointed.
"Beef panang is amazing 
Other then that  for the price you get barely any meat or fish 
The service is a bit slow and not attentive"
It was my first time there... and I must say that the Tonkinoise beef soup was better than I expected. As a PHO/Tonkinoise lover I recommend this place!
"Being in NY (Flushing) area I get access to all Chinese cuisines and this place is authentic.  It will give a run to the best noodles place in NYC.  Only reason for the 4 stars is the long wait and price.   My friend really love the tea egg that came with it.  I thought it was good too and fresh but I don't think I would wait more then 15-20 mins for a seat.  The beef was well favored and the soup was solid. 

I am glad I tried this noodles place as it was on my Montreal's chinatown bucket list.  I enjoyed watching the guy making the noodles in the front window.

I recommend it if you want authentic beef noodless."
"Visited Montreal last summer and we stumbled upon this joint. The beef soup was flavourful spicy but not too salty. We ordered the cold beef with chilli sauce for appetizer; which was surprisingly really good. Cost for both items was less than $20 we will definitely come back."
What a surprise to have this traditional noodles in Montreal.  Not even California has this top quality soup and noodles.  We are marking another stop just to have it one more time before we head back to Boston and then California.  Got to try.
Great noodless and dumplings. Good service and nice people. The pork dumpling soup was awesome. You don't need any sauce to go with it. Flavors are a perfectly savory.
"Authentic chinese food with all the classics.
Got the crispy pancake soup dumplings beef pancake and homemade noodless.
Food was alright I guess I came with higher standards. The soup dumplings were definitely handmade and fresh but they could be more soupy and less doughy. 
The beef pancake was also lacking in beef...the flavour was on point though!
These were basic items I got a lot in Toronto so the prices were a little on the high side. Nevertheless very affordable in terms of getting a good meal in Montreal.
Service was fast and friendly the server spoke in English after realizing my chinese friend and I could not speak the language :( 
Comfortable atmosphere as well! Pretty quiet when we went."
Great noodless!! I ordered the special beef noodless in medium and it was HUGE. The soup noodless and beef were all really tasty.  We came later at night an hour before closing time. There was still a line out the door and we waited probably 15 mins. It was quick. They also brought the food out super quick too. Service was great everyone was super nice.
"I was at this restaurant a few years ago for their pho soup and decided to go back since I was craving a good pho. I attempted to  be adventurous and try a different dish based on the image #1 posted on yelp which for sure was photoshopped and didn't exactly represent the dish.

I ordered #25 which is a beef vermicelli bowl with spring rolls and some lettuce and it came with a small soup as well. My friend ordered the same thing as I did but the chicken version. We were both happy with the soup but disappointed with the beef and chicken vermicelli bowl. It lacked color taste and maybe the fact that I had a better version of this dish elsewhere makes me a tougher critique. 

Long story short they make a delicious beef pho soup and in my opinion this would be the best item on the menu to order. Stay away from their vermicelli bowl."
"Honestly as a Chinese noodles here is just good nothing special. However here is not China I don't have so many choices. 

I have lunch here very often since the noodles here is better than that in other Chinese restaurants. I recommend the #2 that is my favorite one noodles with pork sauce. That one is delicious that I can't find anything to substitute it.

They made the noodles in front of their costumers. Many Lanzhou-noodles restaurants doing it in China so I feel it is very common. However here is a non-Chinese guy makes noodles here which makes me feel very interesting:)).

I recommend here totally."
"Pretty decent noodles bowl.  Hand-made noodless super good -- you can choose from 6 size/shape options.  Broth is legit.  The beef noodles soup was pretty good but the sliced beef was just a little unsatisfying -- would have preferred brisket-stlye which would have been a little more tender.  Tendon looked good but I didn't try it.

They also had a Dan Dan style bowl which was super yum would definitely go back for that next time.  

A little cramped but the staff was quite pleasant.  I could see this place being a long wait if you hit it at the wrong time.  

All-in-all a good solid bowl.  You should go."
Had the hand made noodless with vegetable and my friend ordered them with beef. noodless were good everything came out quickly. Efficient service. Both items were $10. My only wish is that more vegetables were in the dish it has a couple pieces broccoli carrots & bok choy. More broccoli would have been good. The beef I didn't care for it had a weird super cheap beef flavor/texture. Not my thing. Otherwise was pretty good & I'd try again but get some different items
"AMAZING!  My husband and i have been ""take out"" from here for the past year.  Always SO relish- and zero mistakes on our order. Always order the Pho Soup- w beef and an order of  spring rolls.  

We decided to stray this week and try recomended Pho Lein which had great reviews.  SUCH a disapointment. When we got home unwrapped the beef to put into the soup - it was already pre cooked? UGH. The beef was fatty and tasteless. 

Pho Bac- great portion sizes fresh taste and delish! 
Be prepared w/ cash only and time to look for parking"
"Great dinning experience. 
I went with a friend who eats here a lot and served as my 'menu guide'. He talked me into sharing a first course dish of raw beef with lemon onions and peanuts that was served with a fish sauce on the side. Fan-frigging-tastic! scooping it with shrimp crispies kinda reminded me of really fresh mexican nachos (with an Asian twist to it). It was a big dish and we didn't even finish it before our mains arrived.  By my friend recommendation I took the L size soup.  It turned out to be way too much together with the first course... but I  loved it. I got the beef pho with everything (raw beef flank beef beef balls with a weird condensed texture some sort of intestines that were too chowie for by taste). Of course there were noodless and green onions in the broth (which was good) as well as extra sprouts and holly basil on the side. Very satisfying dish. I'm glad I had it and that I got to try different types of beef additions to my soup - to find out what I like a lot and what's not really for me. 
My friend had a good beef noodless and veggies dish which was also a success. 
I loved this place!
It's by far the best Vietnamese restaurant place I have been to."
"Lawdamercy! 
This place was off the hook!

It was a delicious meal for a great price!
I had the small combo of the regular beef soup- spicy and it was one the best tasting beef soup with noodless I've ever had. The noodless were bomb the soup was perfect for Montreal's cold weather and the tea egg was yummy. The portions are huge!! 

This place is always busy and crowded so my part of 2 had to share a table but we did not care. We drank the delicious tea they served us and merrily ate our dishes and left with a full warm belly. 

Only thing is the service is a little mehhhh but I could look past that."
Quick service. The use of msg is a quite blatant especially in the chicken pho broth. Servings are pretty generous in noodles not so much in meat. But I did enjoy the beef itself both the thinly sliced juicy brisket and the rare sirloin were on point.
"Excellent beef hand pulled Lan-Zhou noodles soup this little restaurant is conveniently located on Saint Laurent in the same building as the Asian market which is located on the bottom floor beneath the restaurant . There are three main soup types beef chicken and pork all served with hand pulled Lan-Zhou noodless the most popular is the beef and for good reason it's fabulous with a very rich spicy beefy broth.There are three soup sizes small medium and large the two larger sizes can be easily shared as they are hugh; the spiciness of your dish can be selected as well. This is a tiny space seating no more than 20 people at most and gets very crowded quickly but the line seems to move fairly well. This is a great stop for lunch and then a visit downstairs to the market to pick up some of your favorite items. This should be on your list of stops when visiting Montreal."
We came to Pho Bac 97 for a snack before dinner. We ended up ordering the bun bo hue. The original bun bo hue comes with pigs blood and pig feet. I opted out of that and only got rare beef. Usually the soup comes steaming hot and the rare beef gets cooked. In this case the soup was luke warm so basically my beef was rare the entire time. I was lucky I didn't get sick after eating that.  Even my noodles was supposed to be milk noodless but was given pho noodless!  Other than the temperature of the soup it was flavourful with a hint of shrimp flavour. It was pretty tasty. The restaurant was quite dirty with sticky floors. They didn't have any of the milk shake like all the typical Vietnamese restaurants would have. All in all ok but would not come back.
Best Thai Basil Beef Stir-Fry bar none.
Maybe it wasn't a good day I went to but the crepes were mediocre and the soup dumplings had no soup. Small portions for the price.
pricey ethiopian food.  very dark interior.  slow service.
If you're looking for montreals best Vietnamese restaurant this is it. Excellent food excellent service and very fast! I always get the vermicelli platter with beef and shrimp
We came here with a large group. Adults and children. Staff was quick and efficient. Food was very good and authentic. The pho noodles soup was delicious as was the grilled pork chop. Soup broth had depth. Vietnamese iced coffee was on point too!
My Vietnamese friend recommends this place strongly! I have tried Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodles) and Pho Dac Biet I like the broths very much. It seems a family restaurant not the kind to sell to tourist. The place is very clean with friendly service and the price is sweet ! (cash only  btw! )
"I'm not a fan of this type of noodles soup but if you like clear broth this will be your jam! Hand pulled noodless of the flat kind or the round kind and you get to choose your width/thickness respectively. 

The noodless are simple al dente and satisfying. You can watch as they slam the dough in the front to make the noodless! 

A fellow diner recommended getting the special lanzhou beef noodles combo because you get a bang for your buck. $13CAD for a veggie app and noodles soup that comes with their hard boiled tea egg. Get it spicy or sans spicy. Spicy isn't really spicy to be honest but adds to the flavor. If someone wanted to go again I'd go again and order the braised beef tendon noodless (it's a chef recommended dish too!) 

The line gets long here so be prepared to wait! It's a tiny hole in the wall that shares it's space with an escalator to the grocery store in the basement. If you need to go to the bathroom good luck navigating because it's a 10 step process. Great service. Lemon water refills. Once you're done eating get up to pay by the service station."
Somehow I have hard time digesting this noodles. Perhaps too much gluten. There are other handmade noodles places in town. This one is popular as it has the most visibility.
"Always come here for a bowl of pho when I come to south shore. Big portion and decent soup base. The restaurant is quite spacious and service is fast.

I"
"Hit or miss restaurant. 2.5 stars

Really depends on what u order. The pork ribs noodles is pretty descentbecause the meat is tender and flavorful.

Today i ordered the beef shankand found it underwhelming the beef didn't have much flavor to it they should make a real hao lam meen instead.

The soup base is all the sameand taste more on the sweet side rather than meaty flavors. 

The noodless are descent as wellsometimes undercookedso u have to soak it in your soup before eating it.

A good about the place is they only charge 1 dolla for double the amount of noodlesswhich is totally worth it  cause or else you won't be full from their regular portions.

Conclusionbetter than nothin when you are really craving for some soup noodless."
I've been going to this noodless place for quiet a while now and I have to say the quality has been consistently good. Their pulled chicken noodles soup with sesame sauce is my favorite. I do recommend this place to all noodles lovers! It's tasty and affordable and portion is just right for a lunch.
"We came to this restaurant 15 minutes before they supposedly close but it looks like they kept taking in people as they came in. In a small kitchen with a window facing the street the cooks made fresh noodless (to the width ordered- narrow to very wide) cooked noodless added sides and broth. It is an amazing production. We had the cucumber and seaweed salad which tasted fresh and nicely pickled. We had the cold marinated sliced beef with scallions hot pepper sauce and peanuts. This was a nice addition to our beef noodles soup. I got the wide noodless which went well with the excellent broth scallions and beef. 

We are happy we stopped by here for an excellent meal and service. They only take Canadian debit cards and cash."
Great food! We had the za jian mien and beef noodles soup and believe me when I say unless you have a huge appetite one bowl was enough for two ppl! The hand pulled noodless had good nite to it and the sauce was delish. The appetizers were also very good had the pickled cucumber and the sliced beef not too spicy either. The place is super small and gets packed quick you most likely will be rubbing elbows with strangers but the food is good and the service friendly !
Great deal caring service and somewhat different soup in my pho experience. Delish thin rice noodless in perfection :D loved the temperature of my pho. Will come back soon!
Very small place which is located above an entrance to an Asian grocery store. Had to wait 5-10 mins for a table on a Friday night around 7pm. Very fast service. The texture of the noodless was amazing and the soup flavorful. Large portions - got the small soup which was more than enough.
Get here early as the line is long.  It moves quick but expect a line.  We waited around 5-10 minutes so not too bad when you're hungry.  We order the pulled beef soup and the spicy meat noodles plate.  It was very good.  My only wish is to have a few more options on the menu.  They make noodless fresh by the front window. With noodless so greasy and tasty a couple more items would be awesome.  Otherwise I would highly recommend this place if you like noodless and soup.
"Saw a nearby yelper post photos and review for this place and it immediately caught my attention.  We dropped by for lunch on Tuesday and my hubby and I were blown away by the flavors.  I don't think we've ever tasted any beef noodles soup that was this perfectly seasoned and well balanced. The restaurant is pretty small with about 10 tables and a long table against the wall w/ stools and a few seats in front of their kitchen.  The restroom is on the 5th floor of the building that you have to access w/ a service elevator.

We ordered:

Julienned squash & seaweed salad - refreshingly perfect! The sweet salty and acidity levels were all in perfect harmony.

Cucumber appetizer - the cucumbers were coated in a creamy porky and spicy sauce. It had a nice amount of heat and very tasty.

Cold beef w/ chili oil - served w/ scallions 1 broccoli and 1 cauliflower and sate chili oil. The chili oil was packed w/ flavor and had a slight delicious garlic flavor.  This definitely elevated the dish.  This beef is the same beef they use in the noodles soup dish.

Beef noodles soup (Large) - WOW this bowl was HUGE! Luckily hubby and I shared this bowl.  The noodless meat broth and chili were all PERFECTION. We added an egg to this dish for an extra $1. The egg was full of flavor and hubby enjoyed it very much.  There was also daikon in the bowl but I didn't eat it.  Wish it came with some greens but that's okay b/c we had 2 veggie sides to eat along with the noodles soup.  

Our lunch was so good that we came back and ordered the zhajiang mian and the julienned squash & seaweed salad togo for dinner. 

Zhajiang mian - huge portion served w/ broth on the side.  The pork and fermented black bean sauce was delicious.  This bowl had julienned carrots bok choy edamame and pieces of pickled mustard greens.  It was definitely tricky tossing the noodless when we got back to our hotel b/c the noodless had congealed together.  A few minutes in the microwave loosened up the noodless which solved the issue.

Overall we would definitely return to this restaurant if we visit Montreal again.  Delicious food fast service and very affordable/cheap prices!"
"As good as I would expect from a popular restaurant though not uniquely delicious. And that's perfectly fine! My mother loves ???? (beef noodles soup) and we figured we might as well eat here while we were visiting Montreal. The beauty of the beef noodles soup here is that you can choose the width and size of your noodless because they make their noodless in-house. That's amazing.

There are so many widths and sizes to choose from my indecisive heart almost could not handle it. I opted for ?? (""2-xì"" lit. ""2-thin"") which was cylindrical and relatively thick and it was just right for me. My mother got the ?(""ku?n"" lit. ""wide"") which was definitely wide relative to my 2-xì. They were both good and chewy. Our bowls were huge! Makes the price definitely worth it.

I don't know if it was a function of the noodless in general being the soup for long but when I was helping my mom finish her ku?n noodless they seemed to have dissolved slightly into the soup making them more doughy than I wanted. I know they make the noodless fresh (you can see them make it in the shop which is super cool). I liked my 2-xì noodless."
"Rather small shop with a Chinese grocery store beneath. Arrived around 2:15 and there was still a 10 Minute wait! There was no line when we left though - around 3:00 PM.

Anyways the noodless are fantastic! I really liked the da kuan which was the biggest square noodles. My sister loved the thinnest noodless. We also got the thickest circular noodles but that was a bit on the chewier side for my tastes.

We got the special beef (not the beef noodles soup served seasonally) Dan Dan and veggie flavors. Highly recommend the first two the veggie not so much. It had a strange coconut flavor to it and while I do like coconut I wasn't feeling it in this soup.

As long as you don't get the veggie the food is great and the service is fast. I can't imagine what the wait would be during normal hours though. Also the portion sizes are huge. The small was more than enough for just me. Of course I finished it cause it was so good but I left feeling like I was going to burst."
I ordered chinese pickle and pork slice noodles.  Taste is good but too oily.  Doesn't worth to try.   Service is very good. Maybe next time will try their steamed dumplings.
Soup was extremely salty and the brown noodles was bland.   If they can mix the flavor between the dishes then it might have been ok at best
I'm not the best judge of Viet fare but I love this place and return whenever I can always to order the Bun Cha soup and/or the beef salad.
Hey great place and reasonable.  The dumplings are fried and tasty.  I ordered satay beef soup large-it was plenty.  My friend got vermicelli pork and it was more than enough.  Our whole bill was under 40 CD.  Service is great.  You need to byob and the space is funky being a concerted residence.   Enjoy!
noodles factory is my usual greasy Chinese noodles spot. It's not the cleanest it's not the best service but when you're on the mood for 10$ greasy noodless the Shanghai noodless hit the spot! I'll keep swinging by when my craving hits.
The hand pulled noodless were superb! I just wish the soup was a little more flavorful. This place needs AC or lot more fans..I was sweating like crazy. I couldn't get the famous beef tendon noodless it was only available on the weekends. But I ordered a small beef noodles and it was more than enough. My brother who usually eats a lot couldn't finish his medium. Street parking only. You have to go downstairs and to the second floor for the washrooms.
"The beef noodles soup is huge! They have Small Medium Large sizes and my friend and I split a medium but the bowl looked huge. It actually was a lot of broth but not as many noodless as you would think. We weren't super hungry so the medium was a perfect size for us to split. The beef broth was clear flavorful and had a nice sweet tanginess. You can customize the thickness of the noodless and we just chose regular which looks like spaghetti noodless. The beef was thinly cut and tender.

Delicious hearty and filling - a bowl of beef noodless will warm you up during the cold winter months. And the best part is the noodles shop also has a downstairs escalator that goes to an Asian supermarket so you can pick up some drinks or snacks on your way out. The downstairs market is amazing since they have like Chinese Lay's with unique flavors like cucumber and grilled eel + Hojicha Kit-Kats that I thought were a Kyoto-exclusive."
Expectations? Fresh quick and tasty. Non-expectations? Variety room to stretch exchanging patter with the staff. Oh and at a very very reasonable price.  This Chinese beef noodles shop is everything one can reasonably want. The noodless are stretched and slapped and twirled and twisted in the front window. Based on the orders the noodles-maker prepares different sizes plops a portion into a vat of boiling water. A few minutes later another person scoops up the noodless drains them and puts them in a bowl to which a ladle or two of simmering  clear beed broth is added. At the next station is the daikon cilantro chili oil (if so requested) beef slices tea egg (if requested). There are three sizes and the medium is enough for a football player. There are a few other items like spicy cucumber and edamame. We had two small beef noodles soups with moxi and Jo Yen style noodless. There are few seats maybe ten tables and another ten at the counters so we had to wait ten minutes for a table. Service was fast price was great! If you are looking for cantonese or Szechuan or Thai or a Chinese banquet there are a dozen other places within blocks. This place is for beef noodless.
"****VEGETARIANS THIS IS YOUR PLACE*****

Rant: It's a darn shame when you're craving a good noodles soup and can't find a place with an actual vegetarian broth. Yes I'll cave and have the chicken broth but damnit I want a guilt free delicious noodles soup and I want it now!

The good news is I've found it. Lan Zhou has the most incredible hand pulled noodless which are slightly chewy and oh so fresh. Their vegetable noodles soup comes in a different broth that they make and tastes incredible. I asked the waiter what the broth is made of and he said it's a secret recipe - how alluring. The coolest part is you can ask for the noodles size you want when you order because they make them to order. 

I would have given the place 5 stars if the seating was a bit nicer and comfortable - the over all ambience of the restaurant isn't special but the food is well worth it."
EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE.  Good food.  Great location.  Get reservations.
Epic noodles shop! The portions are HUGE (a small can easily feed an adult) and you get to pick your own noodles thickness which they make by hand right in the front window.
Authentic and tasty! noodless are just right with beef broth and a tea egg! The service is surprisingly great given this is a very affordable place! Will definitely come back for my next visit!
We stumbled upon this place passing by it and noticed a line. This is the best Lan Zhou noodles we have ever had. Portion is very generous and the beef soup are delicious and hand drawn noodless are made to perfection. Spicy version give a little kick but adds a great flavor. Highly recommend this place if you like noodless!
Soup is amazing and noodless are chewy and has nice texture! The salads aren't that good though. Would go here again for the soup and price :)
This place is a hidden gem. The tastiest bon bo hue spicy beef noodles in North of USA's border. Truly authentic Vietnamese food. We will definitely come back if we are in Montreal.
We ordered the classic pork soup dumplings. Obviously the main character in this dumpling is the soup but it still does contain meat. There's a certain technique that one needs to eat a soup dumpling with finesse. It goes without saying that if this little steamed pocket of boiling soup is placed in front of you unless your mouth in lined with asbestos you're not going to toss the sucker into your mouth immediately. Let it sit in your dipping sauce for 20 seconds to cool off place it in your spoon and nibble a hole to release the soup into your spoon then enjoy.
I love Vietnamese food and I love pho soup. I was on a look out for a quick bite to eat when I've came across this place. The decor is very outdated inside but overall looked clean. The service is just okay polite but not overly friendly. My soup was not as I anticipated it to be the broth just didn't taste as rich as I've tried in other places. However my friend's soup (it wasn't not pho) was delicious. I may come here again but probably order something different on the menu.
"Pho Tay Ho has a nicely decorated interior and outdoor areas in the front and in the back. The menu has a nice variety of Vietnamese dishes and you order yourself with the paper and pencil provided. The food came out quickly although service could have been a bit more attentive. Ca Phe Phin Sua Da was a little too bitter even though we asked for extra condensed milk. The Sau Dau Nanh tasted perfectly sweet. It was my first time having Bo Tai Chanh and wow was it good. Great flavors and there was a good amount of rare steak.  The Bun Hoac com bo nuong was okay. The noodless were abundant and cooked well; while the beef tasted delicious it was a bit too chewy at times.  Now I thought the pho was delicious. However it did not remind me of pho. It reminded me of chicken noodles soup like Campbell's Chicken noodles Soup. This is good but it is not what I'm expecting when I order beef pho. It tasted like they used a chicken broth and added beef. Their rare steak well done beef flanks and meatballs were also good. There was only 1-2 quarter slices of meatballs though but the flank was abundant and had fatty ends to it that were cooked perfectly. It's not an extraordinary place but it's definitely worth a stop if you are in the area."
Just walk an extra 10 mins to Chinatown. Far from authentic. The pho was not even close it's suppose to be a beef broth but this was straight up sugar and soy sauce soup.
"So healthy. 
Delishous 
It is a good place to gather with your fitness friend. 
A soup could be a good gift for a friend with cold  flu or Covid
I recommend the meat soup."
"Went here on a whim because of some Chinese food cravings. It's a really small place so if you want to come come early. 

The food is actually really good! We ordered everything to have less salt and all the dishes that came out still had lots of flavour without the super saltiness. 

Beef rice noodles was my favourite followed my Singapore style fried noodles then the handmade stir fry noodless with beef. Caution about the Singapore style fried noodles though - when you order it less salt there is also significantly less curry and spices added to it. 

We also ordered the steamed soup dumplings but they were only so-so. 

The staff were friendly and food literally flew out of the kitchen. Make sure you bring cash though - it's the only method of payment they accept. 

I actually really liked this place and would definitely come again."
"A nice place to have lunch in between classes. 
The service is fast the food is inexpensive (they have lunch specials for 8$ includes soup and meal) and they accept cards.

I got the general tao chicken with a won ton soup and Adam got the sesame chicken with the spicy soup.

The spicy soup was too spicy! I recommend getting the won ton.
Both of our meals were good. The little salad on the side was the only thing that looked a bit bleh. It was just lettuce on a plate so nothing appetizing about that.

I'd go back!"
Service was slow... Didn't offer us drink menu.... Didn't give us water refill.... We ordered miso soup grilled squid yakitori carpaccio gentleman my life and duo. The miso soup according to my friend she knew which brand of miso soup they were using... Aka bought from the store and it was five dollars each. Grilled squid and yakitori were okay nothing special. Carpaccio and gentleman were good. The beef in my life was not tender. It was average standard. The rice in the sushi and the makis in the duo was awful.... Not sticky not flavored.
"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED... I myself is part Chinese & my bf is full Chinese. I love sharing my culture & our food. My boyfriend & I travel a lot and we love to check out the Chinatowns at all the places we go to especially him. We saw the good reviews this place got so we decided to check it out. noodles soup after a long day of walking & exploring Montreal on a cold winter day sounds like a great ideas right?! I regret it. But let me give some pros & cons. 

Pros: We got seated right away & it was a busy Friday night. The service was so so. Nothing to brag about. The food came out quick and hot. The prices are very cheap. 

Cons: Cash only. For a place called ""noodles factory"" one would think there will be a LARGE selection of different noodles entrees to choose from. NOT. They have a handful but it's more of like corner Chinese store selections. I couldn't decide what I wanted because the menu didn't really intrigue me so I went with the classic wonton noodles soup. You can't mess up with that right? WRONG. Typically wonton noodles soup contains egg noodless a thin yellow noodles. The menu didn't specify so I asked the waiter can I have it with egg noddles. He quickly gave me an attitude as if he was upset or something and pointed to the menu and told me to pick one of their other noddles. I didn't want to make a scene so I told them I'll take it as it however they make them. My bf order their spicy pork & vegetable handmade noodless. As soon as they brought out my wonton noodles soup I was already disappointed. The bowel did not look appeasing at all. First there were shredded cabbage in the soup. NEVER have I had it with that. Traditionally there's bok choy & green scallions & this bowl didn't have neither of that. The noodless was probably their hand noodless which was a thicker white noddle. Both the noodles & shredded cabbage was over cooked. The broth was flavorless actually tasted like shredded cabbage. The wontons looked liked tiny amount of pork was quickly shoved into the wonton sheets & they didn't care if the meat fell out or not. There was already barely meat to begin with. Same goes for my bf's bowel. The noddle soup was so bland we had to force ourselves to even try to eat half of it because we didn't want to waste food. I'm pretty sure they can tell we didn't really enjoy our food because after we paid they felt the need to come to our table & remind us to leave tip on the table. We literally just got up to put our coats on not even a full minute took place yet. As nasty as I may review a place I ALWAYS LEAVE TIP. Heck I work for tips myself at a nail salon. So for a place to be like that it made my experience even worse. So after this terrible experience we actually went to go eat Ramen noodles at another location outside of Chinatown & it was AMAZING!"
"The noodless and broth were top notch. I wouldn't mind if the beef was a little less grisly (maybe I am a stupid American).  The soup was less greasy than similar soups I've had around Boston n

The portions are actually obscene especially since hand pulled noodless are very filling. I had a medium soup and was unable to finish it. 

Had the house soup and plan to return next year to try others. 

The place is a little dingy and cramped thus only 4 stars."
The texture of the noodles was excellent. That tells me they had a master noodles maker making it. The soup was a bit bland by comparison. But they do not skimp on the portions with the noodless or the side dishes. Make sure you're hungry when you go.
"Great rare beef  pho... broth was perfect  served nice and hot good amount of beef.  Very reasonable prices too. .. 7.75$ for a small and I think around 8.75$ for a large.  had the imperial rolls too and they were delicious!   Friendly service.  Will definitely be back.
only small issue was finding parking. but that has nothing to do with the quality of  food at this restaurant!"
"We have a little one with us and a lot of the reviews on here about the crammed seating had us worried. However upon arriving to this hand-pulled noodles house (to the 30 min wait line at around 6:30pm on a Friday night) we thought the dining area isn't bad at all rated under my ""Chinatown"" standard tbh. Yes the seatings are smaller and closer together like in typical Food stalls in Asia so be prepared if you don't like that sort of environment. All dine-in patrons must show proof of vaccination upon seating. The waitstaff was swift and accommodated us with a 4-top table so we can put our babe away from people. The menu has large realistic pictures which makes it easy to order. The noodless come in 5-6 sizes from ramen thin to 2/3inch thick. You can choose SM or Lg portion and there's an option to combo side salad and tea-marinaded boiled egg.  I also appreciate that they took out appetizers really quickly and order came out fast. Once you're done just pay up front (cash/debit only) 

We ordered medium bowls of traditional spicy beef Lan Zhou noodles size 4 and spicy beef tendon noodles size 3 along with edamame with pickled veg salad and a cold spicy beef slices. The cold beef slices was ok as it wasn't super tender but not the worst I've had. The edamame was delicious with a hint of spice and nuttiness from the fermented cabbage. The noodles was great like any hand-pulled places the broth though was light but flavorful with nice good quality beef. I especially loved the beef tendon as they are so tender and has a bit more rich broth flavor. 

Very affordable price too of Canadian$14-16 a bowl. It's a steal! 

Their takeout packaging looks legit as well separating the noodless and broth in a plastic bowl ready to mix."
"I along with the few who gave this place less than 4 stars were drawn by the many praises of fellow Yelpers. Tasting is believing and I honestly don't think this place deserves any more than 2 stars. Reasons:

1) The place is located in a corner section above a supermarket. Seating is extremely limited like less than 40 and if you have a party of less than 4 you're likely to be seated with strangers in the same table. The wait can be atrocious. 

2) The noodles: while it was made in front of me I found it to be undercooked and not the true Lanzhou ""chewy"". It's OK but seriously you can get better noodless in the supermarket below. 

3) The soup stock: tasteless and salty like someone took tap water added beef stock and salt and called it a day. 

4) The beef: it was...okay. 

The Lanzhou beef noodles place in Philly is way better but driving 7 hours south is probably not in most people's interest for Lanzhou beef noodless."
Nice cozy place and really good food. Good vegetarian options as well. We tried Pad Thai and vegan soup. Both were superb. Service was great as well. Will go again!
"Wow! I think this may have been the best noodless I've tasted in a long time. The noodless are hand pulled right in the store. You can choose the size and shape of the noodles (thin thick flat etc). I wasn't able to taste MSG in the soup which is a plus. The noodles bowl just had the right balance of meat carb and vegetables to make it a satifying and delicious meal.

The service was prompt and the interior was clean. I think all quick serve Chinese places should aim for what this place has achieved. This noodles joint is definitely worth a detour to Chinatown!"
"Excellent food court restaurant. I still love chez Lan better.  
Haven't been this place since I graduated. They change their servings bowl to a thin plastic one. The portion goes smaller than before. The beef noodles soup also changed from a dark colour to a more clear look similar to Lan. 
I used to get a free pop drink with my student ID. 
Good old memories changed a bit. A little disappointed. Still worth a try."
"Always crowded be prepared to wait.

Quick service.

Large portions. A small here is a medium elsewhere a medium here is a large elsewhere etc.

Delicious hand made noodless soup base is good if you just ask for a little spicy. They don't skimp on the meat either.

Pro-Tip: dump the rest of your edamame appetizer in your soup and eat it with the noodless."
Service here was fast and they are open late. I ordered three soups:  wonton soup hot and sour soup and tom yum tofu soup.  Out of the three the wonton soup stood out for its flavor. It was a tasty broth and the wontons were cooked nicely and there was a good amount of them in there. The other two soups were average but cheap. My friends ordered the beef drunken noodless. They ordered it with no onions less oil and extra spicy. It came out quickly with extra onions extra oily and not spicy at all. It was an okay dish but my friends were upset that they received the complete opposite of what they ordered. Plus their restroom is small. The toilet is right against the wall. Recommend this place as a late-night Chinese cheap option with lowered expectations.
Best noodless ever!  Make sure to stop in and experience the soup. Add extra beef and ask for it spicy!  The spicy cucumber salad and edamame is fantastic!  Enjoy!
"Food portions (Pad Thai Pad Kee Mao)were all over the place too many veggies:noodles portion. Chicken was too dry. 

Egg rolls were good. 
Soup was good. 

2/5 experience."
"Really really cheap price for great authentic food.
I ordered the spicey beef noodles was not disappointed at all. All the dishs are under 10$.
The owner is super friendly!"
I don't understand how I've not heard of this place! I have heard of it as the noodles place with the supermarket downstairs but you should all remember that it's called LAN ZHOU. They have delicious asian noodless with an assortment of different noodles thickness and shape of the noodles. I would go for the small if you're not too hungry. If you're starving you should get the medium. Their sizes are humongous and remember that it's noodless in soup as well and soup really fills you up! Their spicy is a little bit too spicy for my liking but these noodless will turn your sad day upside down. You can also watch the employees make noodles by the window at the front or inside. It's pretty mesmerizing watching them make the noodless. Don't come in a group of more than 4 since there isn't that much seating.
Was feeling under the weather and thought some soup would help. This was a first time visit ordered a soup with some veggies. Soup tasted great but what was the cherry on the icing is when I asked to pack up what was left (which was most of it) the employee came back out and said he'd added broth and a small chili into the soup to help me feel better. Such a small gesture but what a kind gesture. I'll be back for sure.
"I've never had this type of noodless before so not a ton to compare them too but I thought the noodles soup was delicious... It was cool to see them hand making the noodless at the front window. I liked that there weren't a ton of choices which kept ordering more simple... If you're going to get the traditional soup it basically just choosing your thickness of noodles and then whether you want spicy or not!

I don't think that getting a large is worth the extra two dollars... I think I definitely would have been satisfied with the medium. I didn't have the thinnest noodles option but my friend did and those were my favorite. 

I prefer pho over these noodless but pho is basically my favorite thing on earth. I'd definitely recommend this and I will come back next time I'm in town!"
Great social mission.  Okay-ish food.  Decent location.  Untrained service.
really delicious food and friendly staff. tried imperial rolls seaweed salad hot and sour soup general tso chicken satay souce beef and pad thai noodless. all were really good cannot pick a favorite.
"We had the spicy beef shank soup and the #1 Chicken soup noodless.   Both were really excellent.   The noodless were really good.  The dishes came with plenty of nicely-cooked meat and some baby Bok Choy

We came at a slow time so the wait was not an issue.

This is way better than I expected in a food court."
"Wow 

A real revelation that's been on my radar for some time. 
NB it is closed on Tuesdays :) as we once sadly found out.

This place is packed despite being quite large prepare to wait during the evening. Takeout is a good option.

The nicely pictures menu it is gigantic and leans heavily on beef and chicken. Going with people who've eaten there definitely helps.

We got duck chicken beef shrimp mussels and even a veggie dish. The selection is truly astounding.

Quick breakdown of the meals total with tax and tip is about $140 for 8 huge plates.

Awesome ""crispity"" sesame beef
Mussels in Thai Sauce
Won Ton Soup with shrimp
Hong Kong noodless with beef
Duck in Oyster Sauce
Morning Glory in garlic sauce
General Tao Chicken
Crispy Chicken

The top 3 were my faves I love General Tao but this one was not as crispy and missing the spicy kick to complement the sweet.

The service is blazing fast there's a huge waitstaff and lots of kitchen workers so not much chance to socialize as they're quite busy.

Overall would definitely go back and can finally give a quick answer if someone asks me if there's any good Asian spots outside downtown

A wonton soup was just a delightful way to start off probably also the healthiest thing as well."
"YUM!!! FIVE STARS. We came here mid-afternoon around 2:00 PM on a Tuesday after a horrible dining experience our first night in Chinatown Montreal the evening before. 

This place is comfy hip -- wooden tables and chairs. A bit smaller for a noodles joint but still very homey and ""cozy"" especially when it's 20 degrees F outside. There's a window in front of the restaurant where you can see the noodless being handmade from scratch from the outside. They make fresh noodless for each bowl ordered. It was very interesting to see how the dough was rolled cut simmered in broth -- all by hand. Note that there is a big stairwell to an underground supermarket in the middle of the store. Although some may say it takes away from the ambience it didn't bother us too much! 

The service - pretty above average. We were seated quickly given hot tea and a pitcher of lemon water and had our order taken right when we came in. Noted that it was a slow mid-week afternoon so perhaps Friday and weekend nights are a bit more difficult to be seated in such a timely manner. Our order came out in about 15 minutes.

The food - EXCELLENT. There's only 3 options of which soup to order on their menu: a vegetarian option a pork soup and a beef soup. I ordered the beef soup -- their most popular one. They had 3 sizes: Small ($7.99) Medium ($9.99) and Large ($11.99). I ordered a Medium. They also give you the option of spicy or non-spicy. I had spicy.

The portions are HUGE. My medium bowl came out to be about 11""-12"" in diameter. Lots and lots of noodless broth was seasoned with spices and pepper a handful of beef steaming hot. The spoon they also give you is also very interesting (think stew soup instead of typical Asian soup spoon) and it was a GREAT meal. I was full afterward and for the affordable price for such a large serving size -- I will definitely come here again and again next time in Montreal. 

Final notes - The broth was flavorful the noodless were very fresh and the beef was great. I was extremely impressed by the efficiency of the service and of course the portions for the price. Five stars for a great simple and authentic dining experience. 

Helpful tips - if you have a large appetite for meat they offer ""extra"" beef (or any meat that comes with the soup you order) and ""extra"" noodless for an additional $2-3. My normal Medium bowl was more than enough for me so it wasn't an issue at all! Furthermore the ""spicy"" option is not too hot for those who prefer a ""no sweat"" spice kick.

If you come to Chinatown Montreal I really recommend dropping by this place by all means. I wish they would open one of these in the States as I can see myself grabbing a handful of friends every weekend for lunch AND dinner. Hot fast and fresh. 5/5!!!"
"Ordered the special chicken noodles. What makes it special? The fact that the cow rolled over the chicken that crossed the road that ended up in my bowl of noodles soup. Slices of raw beef flank topped the bowl that featured pieces of chicken both large and small. To make this order of Pho Ga double special was the fact that I got the one chicken gizzard liver and heart. I know what you're thinking ""how can one bowl of noodles soup contain so much awesome without exploding singing hot soup all over your tshirt"". Subsequent soup spatter did however end up on my shirt - that's only because I'm clumsy. The added offal added a rich and deeper flavour to the soup - it's not for everyone just the ridiculously good-looking.

Pho Tay Ho has been at this location for as long as I can remember and as long as I can remember the food has always tasted the same. Consistency doesn't seem to an issue for them as their formula for deliciousness cannot go wrong. Not only do they specialize in chicken pho but subsequently all things chicken various chicken dishes on the menu can be found. You can disagree but like I said before Pho is the ultimate blitz there are so many variations that each place will surely be different from another and that's something I can guarantee. That's why you'd got to try them all before you find the one you like... like dating."
"A good variety of Szechuan and Thai food.  We were 4 people.  We had pepper chicken sesame beef beef & broccoli crispy noodless with shrimp and shrimp with eggplant.  Everything was delicious.   The service was friendly and prompt.   We love that you can bring your own wine.  
Prices are a bit lower than other Asian restaurants and the atmosphere is relaxed.   We will return."
A very special place to have Chinese tapas. I like the dumplings so much! And I have to say the crispy pancake tofu soup Chinese pork sandwich calzone lamb noodles are sooooo good and yummy!!!!!
"When I'm feeling a little under the weather my mind immediate shifts to soup.  Warm slurpy delicious soup.  And when I'm stuck  downtown at work I need warm delicious slurpy soup that's quick and nearby.  And Nu-Do fits the bill.  

Located in the food court at the Eaton Center it isn't the first place I'd think to get my soup fix but it works.  They do takeout putting the noodless and toppings in one container and the soup in another so you don't need to sit in the food court to enjoy (though it can be fun to people watch). A bowl of bbq pork noodles soup will cost you less than $10 so it doesn't break the bank either. It isn't particularly spicy yet it's flavorful so when I need to get the sinuses moving I make sure to load up on the hot sauce to add in.  

As an added bonus while waiting for your soup you get to be entertained by the cook pulling the noodless.  It can get loud as the dough is repeatedly banged on the counter but oh so worth it."
Got the best seat in the house to see how the magic happens with the hand made noodless!! The soup was great!! The beef was sooooo soft and well seasoned. Would go back for sure. The service was really great to top it off.
"A great place to go for a big cheap yummy bowl of noodless. Especially good when you're sick.
Definitely go for the classic beef soup. The broth is flavourful and fresh hand-pulled noodless are fantastic."
"I eat a lot of pho especially from toronto so I came with high expectations according to reviews. Large portions and cash only.
Got the first item on the menu which was the mixed beef noodles. 
Meat was drab with no flavour. Didn't really taste fresh so I don't recommend the rare beef noodles. Broth wasn't extremely hot so I don't know if it all cooked down. The tripe was kinda meh as well. 
Good points though: Broth was authentic and noodles texture was also on point.
Usually I get vermicelli at pho places so I might go again and try that? Vermicelli usually comes fully cooked and warm/cold so you don't have to worry about the issues found in the pho here.
Verdict: not a bad choice when you're craving pho but quality has lots of room for improvement."
Very good price and what adds to the dining experience is the fact that there's (almost always) someone who makes noodles in front of you so you know that they actually hand make their noodles which is chewy and tasty in general. I always order the same noodles with meat sauce because it's my fav the other dishes I ordered were really so-so.
"We came in just shortly before they opened at 11am. They let us come in to sit instead of waiting outside. Many others had sat inside already before us. I guess they wanted to avoid long lineup on the side walk during prime hours. They let us browse the menus but they did not take our orders until right after 11 am. A very good blend of tea was also served then as well.

Overall I must say the broth and the noodless were excellent. Very natural beef broth tasting without a lot of salt. Even the side dishes were not bad at all. We tried the house beef noodles in the ""third thin"" size and the dry pork noodless. They let you choose and specify the hand-pulled noodles size from the super thin to super fat depending on your own noodles texture preference. You can even choose the spicy level too.

Even a medium is quite large. Make sure you get their combo to get a side dish a tea egg and a beef noodles in a cheaper combo price vs a la carte pricing. Pork noddle unfortunately only comes in one huge size! We had to pack half of it in the end. Will come back again for sure!"
"Yummy!! 
The spicey satay soup is simply perfect for a chilly evening!"
"Polite service fair price it's a popular restaurant. The favor is a localized Cantonese style. Some of my friends who like salty and spicy favors more doesn't like it. All depends on your stomach :)
Recommend: 
fried noodles with salty sauce"
Flavor was so good. The broth was tasty the beef was thinly sliced noodles was very chewy in a good way. Lots of cilantro! Very reasonably priced.
very delicious food and there are so many beef in it
The best Thai food I have in Montreal. Curry beef and curry sea food is fine. the Tom Yang soup is good. The volume of food is a bit less. And lack of service people although the lady is really helpful. But she is the only person running around.
Sooooo good! I recommend the beef and coriander. Definitely check it out
"Pros: Superb bowl of hand stretch noodles. Good broth fresh products fast service very clean establishment. Complimentary tea is served trough the sitting.  

Cons: Very few menu item some only available on weekend. No washroom are easily accessible and the table are very small like the restaurant. It gets crowded easily.

If you want to slurp up a good bowl of noodles and don't mine XS tables. This is for you!"
This place was the perfect stop on a blistering New Year's Day! The noodless were perfectly al dente the broth was nice and clean although I don't think their spicy is actually spicy. We ordered the Special Beef Beef appetizer pickled cucumbers and edamame - we needed to add some soy to the dishes for flavoring but otherwise everything was cooked well. The restaurant is cozy and the servers are quick and friendly. I like that there is a grocery store downstairs so you could shop while waiting to be seated. Who doesn't love a good bowl of steaming hot noodles soup with -35 windchills outside.
"This will be my first stop the next time I come back to Montreal. There's a large bowl with my name on it. I may not be able to finish it but you bet your elastic waisted pants I will give it my all.

Stick with their specialty - the Beef noodles Soup - with its wonderfully tender beef and deliciously chewy noodless. And you get to choose your noodles shape/size - what fun! The broth was flavorful with a touch of chili oil to give it a little more oomph. Bring tissues for that runny nose. I got a small bowl which was plenty filling with its generous portions. While b.'s Vegetable noodles Soup was decent the odd topping of seaweed salad in the soup turned the broth an unappetizing green color halfway through.

$6.99 for a small $8.99 for a medium and $10.99 for a large.

Seating is crowded so you may end up sharing a table with strangers. There was no A/C when we went and it was a fairly warm day so you may end up sharing a table with sweaty strangers. b. noted that the bowls may or may not be entirely sanitized as the woman seemed to be only rinsing them off with pressurized (hopefully hot) water so don't go licking them clean. The restaurant itself is awkwardly situated above a supermarket with stairs and an escalator right smack dab in the middle. This is a plus for the occasional air-conditioned breeze from below if you're seated by the railing for people watching and for grabbing dessert afterwards - Pocky!"
"Came here on a busy weekend and lined up for about 15min. I noticed the restaurant was filled with Caucasian customers which I unfortunately didn't notice until I was already seated - made me feel like the place was not popular with Asian people who have tougher standards with this type of cuisine. Come on you all know it's true.
*Steamed Chinese dumplings: Much to my joy the waiter confirmed that these are ""Xiao long bao"" (soup dumplings). There isn't much broth in it but they're loaded with very flavourful meat. Not the best soup dumplings I've had but they're loaded with meat which made me happy.
*Wonton (pork) noodles soup: Decent effort at this classic Cantonese dish. I only tried a spoonful of broth and it was light yet savory at the same time and didn't taste too much like canned broth. Another member of my table had this and I didn't try any but he said it was good.
*noodless with spicy vegetables & pork: The least impressive dish of the bunch - nothing ""spicy"" about this and the sauce was not salty enough for my liking.
*Pork & spicy vegetables noodles soup (with handmade noodles): Nice chewy texture of the  handmade noodless. Broth is nicely flavored with less spice than I would have liked.
Friendly service otherwise and it looks like they charged no tax (but are cash only - you get what you pay for). Keep in mind not only am I Asian I grew up on Toronto - so with that experience in mind I feel this place is not amazing but it is okay."
Unassuming storefront in Chinatown that houses amazing hand-pulled noodless. I had the DanDan noodless and my husband had the pork soup bowl. Amazing! The noodless were perfectly chewy and I love that you can choose the noodles thickness (I would recommend 3). His soup broth was so flavorful. Love the vegetable sides too particularly the cucumber salad.
"Most people who like Vietnamese Pho noodless (sometimes referred to as Tonkinese in Montreal) like the Pho Bo noodless which is Beef (Bo) noodless. 

By far the beef is the most popular and has a lot of variations. But if you like Chicken noodles soup (who doesn't especially with a cold?) then Pho Tay Ho is known in Montreal for the best Pho Ga (chicken). 

They don't use free range chicken like Pho Ga An Nam in San Jose CA but they make a good Pho Ga."
"????(LAN Zhou Pulled noodless) has been growing in popularity &  sprucing up everywhere including this Montreal location.

Located in the Chinatown district of Montreal locals & tourists alike are often seen lining up to get a taste of this new craze since the place is very small & only a few tables are available; depending on the time of day expect no less than 30 minute wait time. While awaiting diners can enjoy the art of noodles hand pulling that dates back hundreds if not thousands of years the chefs cook the noodless right in front of diners & mere spectators so get your iPhone & S8+ ready to blog about the experience.

And if you're lucky enough to get a table table sharing may be necessary if alone the noodless cone in a HUMONGOUS size of soup bowl the appearance looks enticing. When ordering I had asked for ""??"" - I.e Big Spicy however it wasn't hot at all. The noodles soup with beef tendons looked delicious but the broth lacked the punch especially considering the craze it has drawn. I thought the meats combination of beef shank slices & tendons tasted better than the rest again expectations were high due to its popularity seen by the daily long lines & social media reviews so my experience was good but not blown away hence no 5 stars.

For those considering trying it I'd do once just to get it off your culinary bucket list but I wouldn't wait in line for more than half-an-hour. In Montreal there are other better options such as Vietnamese Pho noodles soup Schwartz' Montreal Smoked Meats etc"
Service was not great. Food was ok. Beef in black pepper sauce was not good. Beef was very low quality and the sauce was more like a weird gravy. I LOVE this dish and have tried it at many places but it was not prepared like any Chinese place I've ever been to. Other dishes were ok.
"TAKE OUT

This is my first visit in Montreal. The beef noodles soup broth didn't seem to have a lot of msg. It tasted like most of the vietnamese restaurants I've tried. There was a hand full of Vietnamese restaurants but this was the best option. This place got selected since it was the only one I notice that had customers eating. 

The soup in the a separate container was filled all the way up which was not good for putting stuff in when you don't have a separate bowl. They put the noodles and raw meat in one container and the broth in another so they seem to be aware of the noodless getting soggy."
"The crowds gathered around the window are the first sign of something special. Inside are artists (noodles pullers?!) who start with balls of dough and a few minutes later twisting and turning create sumptuous noodless. 

It's tiny and there's a line to get in at lunch but the line moves fast. After being seated at a table with a quiet Chinese couple I realized that the tiny restaurant overlooks the foyer of a grocery store!  Grocery shoppers provide some people watching to accompany the meal.  

The specialty is beef noodles soup. It's warm soothing and satisfying. Highly recommended!"
Absolutely delicious bowl if noidles with beef great flavor and value. Ordered a medium and took 1/2 home.  Would return to sample other items if i lived here.  Highly recommend for food- don't go for ambience or service -just amazing food
Nice ambiance. Great service. Appetizers were well done. The spring rolls were steamed which were okay but would have liked them fried. Skewers are good. Alex gave us great service. Crispy chicken dish was really good. Duck was spicy and excellent. Both pad Thai and other noodles dish were tasty. Ask for some hot chilies with your dishes. Sangria was really good too Definitely would go back again.
This place is pretty overrated. We were in Montreal for the weekend and pretty excited to have hot soup because we were all fighting off a cold. But this place's noodles soup was subpar at best. Not inedible but both the broth and meat were bland. The meat also had a weird aftertaste. Also the line outside the door is a scam!! The only reason they have such a long line is because their service is incredibly slow. Everything from taking our order to preparing our food to bringing us our check--it all took much longer than it should've.
I was not impressed. Had much better chinese noodles soup. Maybe I ordered the wrong item I may give it another chance. Friend had wonton on peanut sauce that was pretty tasty. Overall cost performance was not bad hence 3 stars.
The broth was good in their beef noodles soup. It's was good  but I've had better specially in New York. It was good though. Very fresh ingredients. I'd eat there again but I just wasn't super impressed but it was good. I got the spicy which really didn't have much of a kick. Idk I think I've been spoiled by New York type Chinese food.
"Do you love noodles factory? Your answer is YES? Than noodles factory is for you.

I can say that I know lot of Montreal's Chinatown restaurants. These bistros restaurants etc are not fancy though which is good to enjoy their cultural food. But sometime I can't really get what I want.

From all of them (considering only Chinatown) I love just one - noodles factory - noodless dumplings etc at great price in cosy familiar environment served on your table."
4 stars for the food. 2 stars for the service.  Food is quite good very authentic southern Chinese - among the most authentic I had in MTL. I go there often but service is well...
Excellent food! Homemade noodless. Quick service. Spiced pork is delicious. I recommend highly.
"My go-to place for a quick meal. 
The portion is generous that I can't finish the whole bowl sometimes. I usually order the medium size Lanzhou beef noodles with chili oil. 

It cost around 12$(taxes and tips included).
The noodles is chewy and the soup base is delicious. The beef slices are also well marinated and it has the perfect proportion of tendon and meat.

I also like their cold dishes. The edamame is my favorite and if I am hungry enough I would ask for an extra egg. 
 
The location however is crowded and you may not have enough place to put down ur coat and bags. 
Highly recommend this place for anyone who want try the authentic Chinese noodless with a decent price."
"Super Excellent !  
Very small restaurant but a great experience for soup/ pasta meal."
this place Flank noodles is tasty ?but only available Saturday and sunday.
Food is 5 stars just excellent and Tasty. I docked a star because no spicy beef pho and no yellow noodles options. Rude staff all out rude but almost all the restaurants in Montreal had rude staff.
Enjoyed a delightful beef and snow peas dinner with fried rice. Hot tea a nice accompaniment. Since we has no reservations we were sat with two other groups at a large table. A pleasant conversation took place. This restaurant was obviously very popular. Service was good.
"Freshly made noodless in a small little restaurant! Anyone can watch the masters at work right outside without entering! What a joy!!

This place is bustling with in-and-out's due to the Chinese grocery store downstairs. 

The service is not amazing. The noodless are very cheap though for the size!!! Medium is more than enough for my petite stomach. Amazing value for lunch and dinner.

The noodless are above average the soup is only ok. Overall a little bland for my taste. Beef wasn't that flavourful it didn't soak up the soup enough."
"We were looking for a late night spot and found Restaurant Beijing. The restaurant is in the heart of Chinatown and close to most of the downtown hotels. 

I ordered the roast duck soup which was pretty good. The beef stew soup was good as well. We also ordered the chicken moo shu. The moo shu was good but the pancakes were all stuck together. 

The service is decent. 

If you are looking for a late night spot try Beijing."
Probably one of the freshest chewiest bowls of noodless that I've ever had and it was from a FOOD COURT. That's what amazes me. You can see the chefs hand-pulling the dough to make the noodless as you wait in line. I got the #5 beef shank noodles soup. I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought the soup base could have been better. It didn't really have much depth of flavour but for about $10 after tax in a mall food court this is amazing. If you're looking for a quick bite in the area and are tired of your standard fast food choices I'd come here.
After checking the reviews on Yelp we decided to give the place a try. We came earlier so the restaurant wasn't super full. The service was nice and friendly. We went with this spicy beef soup. Talk about spicy!!! If you like spicy you must try it. We paired it with string beans that were so yummy! I would come back again and try some other dishes.
This is not a fancy upscale restaurant focused on service or presentation just what we were looking for! Good grub and fast quick service. The waiter sized me up and suggested a beef noodless with black bean dish so I obliged. We ordered the lobster with ginger and scallions it was great and only about $20. We also ordered seafood fried rice. Big portions opens late and everything looked good coming out of the kitchen
Right near the Guy-Concordia station this is a good restaurant with fairly diverse offerings of Chinese Singapore and Thai dishes. Service was quick and efficient on a busy Saturday afternoon. I had the Singapore curry beef which was quite good the beef tender and the veggies crisp. The price was quite good for the amount of food--$11.
Food is great. Service is trash. Come for food not for service. We asked for water for a table of 6 and only got 4 cups of water just one example. ?
Awesome find.  This was definitely the busiest prepared food stand at Atwater Market.  Every item on the menu sounded so good that we had a hard time choosing.  We ordered the laksa (spicy noodles soup) and papaya salad.  Both were awesome.
This is probably my favourite ramen shop in all of Montreal. I got about 2-3 times a week and every single time I leave impressed and satisfied. The service is unbelievably quick the food is incredibly  delicious and the price is wonderfully amazing! I consistently get the spicy beef noodles soup with XI size noodless & I have never been disappointed in the many many many times I've gone. I've referred so many of my clients who happen to be Chinese students and they always tell me how amazing it and delicious it was. This restaurant is probably one of the best.
"The reviews about this 'hole in the wall' are not fake.  You will get to eat the best beef noodles soup bowl here.  They have a selection of noodless that are made from scratch.  I went with the suggestion of the waiter.  The medium bowl is large enough when you are starving ;)

The sides salads are very interesting and make for an interesting appetizer.

This is a small restaurant and remains relatively crowded at all times.  Be prepared for a short wait at lunch and dinner time.  Service is super quick and the waiters are very helpful.

The soup bowls taste amazing and keeps you wanting for more.  Pricing is relatively low which makes the experience even better.

Do not forget to take a walk around China Town after your meal to try out some interesting desserts.

Will I return? : Heck yeah!"
"I really feel this place is over-rated. This place was packed and the line was extended out the door morning to night. Initially we really wanted to try the noodless here because a friend recommended this place.  We waited a good 45 mins with the baby standing at the door.  The place was too small for any stroller to go in.  The specialty beef soup noodles was ok but not worth the wait for 45 mins.  Baby ate the beef and liked it. We came from New Jersey; we tasted great and authentic Chinese food.  This place would be an average Joe in jersey yet crowded here.  I mean it was a show for traditional noodles making. I would not wait 45 mins to eat here."
"I generally don't write reviews for highly-rated restaurants that already have hundreds or reviews unless I feel like the aggregated reviews don't accurately reflect the quality of the restaurant.

Nouilles de Lan Zhou is the exception. I couldn't wait to write this review. Someone else on Yelp described these as the best noodless they've had in Canada and I think I have to agree. I got the spicy beef noodles soup combo with #5 noodless (different numbers correspond with different widths of noodles). The combo comes with a choice of a small side (I got the spicy cucumber) and a tea egg.

What do you want from a spicy bowl of beef noodles soup on a cold Montreal day? You want something that will warm you up fill you up and leave you satisfied. This does all that but then it does more. These noodless are absolutely perfect. Just the right amount of chew with their fresh doughy flavour apparent even under the delicious broth. And the broth is delicious. If you get it spicy you're getting it with hot oil so keep that in mind if you want something lighter. But get it hot you'll be glad you did. 

I'll be here every day for lunch until I leave at the end of the week."
It's a small restaurant though so it's a bit of a wait but we weren't in a rush so it's fine. I had a medium beef noodless and it was honestly too big (should've gotten a small). I really like that the soup isn't too salty but it was flavourful. I had the three xi noodless and they were delicious! My friend had the ??? (zajiangmian) and it was excellent too. I'll have that next time because having soup noodless was a workout and a half. Overall great experience just a little bit busy and service is a little slow but the food came fast. Would come again!
"I have been going here for a few years now.  Tonight was the last time.  The service is horrendous.  New staff (it would seem) would rather argue with customers than actually provide decent service.  The issues are not new but the arrogance of the staff - which followed the total lack of service from the staff was unacceptable.  The food isn't as good as it used to be and the service has hit rock bottom.  

It's too bad that you don't care enough to try make something right for someone you know is a regular.  

Your loss."
"Maybe I've been spoiled by a similarly-named noodles shop in one of my US hometowns but after so much anticipation to try the beef noodless here I felt a bit underwhelmed. While the broth had a nice kick to it it was way too salty and the beef slices were thin a bit scanty and very dry and chewy - not tender and melt-in-your-mouth like I've had at other places.

Also I did not realize there was such a range of noodles thickness and while I showed the waitress a picture of the noodless I wanted it seems there was a miscommunication and I ended up with extra-wide noodless which while fresh heavily dominated over the thin beef slices in terms of texture. 

If you are very hungry and crave noodless on a cold day this place will be adequate but sadly it's not the best hand-drawn noodless out there."
"Fast friendly service. Soup was great. Had the beyond burger so it was what it was. Desert was ok but not great. 

Decor is nice. I'd go back would like to try the brunch menu."
Absolutely delicious. I recommend ordering soup non-spicy and adding the sauce if needed.
Delicious noodless. I tried the DanDan - noodless spicy beef nuts ... very good.
Absolutely delicious! Fantastic service beautiful decor and authentic and creative dishes
BBQ Duck and Sesame Beef are to die for ! Very reasonable! Great Value!
Really enjoyed the soup here. Went for a quick bite and the service was quick. Although it is always very crowded and it's a bit tight To sit I would go back to try the different kinds of soups they have to offer. It was very filling. I wasn't able to finish the whole soup so I brought t home and I loved eating it the next day.
"Wow! I don't have too much to say other than this soup really hit the spot! 

So inexpensive and such astounding quality! The homemade noodless are like nothing else. Is there any other way to eat soup?!?!

Can't wait to come back."
Their service was terrible. Walked in without any acknowledgement from the staff and finally we were seated. Had to continuously flag down a waiter to make our order and ask questions. Food wasn't that impressive either really. There's a ton of noodles choices around the city. I'd skip this one
Recently went to Sukho upon covid reopening and the service and safety was great. Food great as usual. Service from Chiara was great kind and courteous. We had a fried mars bar with ice cream for dessert yum!
Excellent noodles soup! However the beef tended to have a lot of fat on it and was chewy (not tender) which was disappointing and unexpected based on previous reviews. The flavor of the broth and the fresh noodless however were stellar. We sat at the small bar when you walk in so we could watch them make the noodless to order which was a nice treat. Two of us got the large soup and split it which was still a lot for two people.  If we return we will probably split the medium instead...
"On a cold windy afternoon you need a piping hot bowl of delicious soup with freshly made noodless. Just be prepared for other people to have the exact same idea.....which means waiting your turn. The location is more of a fast-food set up for noodless because 'the restaurant' wraps around an escalator that leads down to a grocery store. There are tables on a back platform several lining the wall and a couple stools by the door. At peak hours each seat is full of slurping away at their noodless. Thankfully it means that the turnover is quick and you get a turn soon.

The menu is small will less than 5 soup options and several noodles types for mix and match. There are some small side-dishes that can be ordered as an add-on. My bowl felt large even though I did not order a larger size which means that there are plenty of noodless and soup. I had the veggie soup with the flat thin noodless and it was delicious. The soup had a great depth of flavor and the noodless were made perfectly."
"Solid Cantonese in Chinatown that is no frills with the standard fare. The shrimp wonton noodles soup was solid but heads up that the wontons are shrimp only without any pork.  The rice plates are solid with good portions - our beef with vegetables was filled with tender slices of beef and Chinese greens. The tofu and seafood hot pot was solid but the calamari was too tough and chewy for my liking. 

Overall it's not a bad option for traditional Cantonese and the prices are solid. It's a solid 3.5 stars."
#NAME?
My sister and I were so pleasantly surprised by Siam. The beef panang curry was the most delicious curry I've ever tasted. The service was excellent as was the ambience. I highly recommend Siam.
So I can't say I'm a fan. After ordering the traditional beef hand pulled noodles I was quite disappointed. I thought the broth was pretty weak which is made better with the adding of a shitton of vinegar and chili oil. The meat has very little flavour but the noodless are nice when pulled right. A few strains were under/overpulled I might try the Za Jiang Mian but I'll not order the soup noodless anytime soon again.
The hand pulled noodles is very good and huge. They made the noodles fresh per order. You could see them making it through the outside window. Price is reasonable too. There was a long queue of people when we were there on Saturday night.
Regular Chinese hand pulled noodles place. Came here on a Sunday evening at 8:30pm and ordered takeout. People were lining up outside. The noodles was great I had the flat noodless texture was great. I would come back again but would not wait in line to eat this.
Like everyone else I took the special beef noodles soup. The soups was excellent: the broth was perfectly balanced and tasteful. The noodless are freshly made: tasty and just thick enough. The beef is tender and fat enough as well. The medium size is huge be aware! The device is nice only in English tho. I went during a cold night and I had to eat with my winter jacket on. The weird set up some electric stairs going down to the grocery in the basement right in the middle of the place makes it almost windy inside every time someone gets in or out. That's really the only bad comment I have because really for the price you get a real good soup!
"Lan Zhou-style noodless are famous in China and you can find shops all accross the country selling this simple meal. It's usually a small joint with tiny tables and even tinier chairs. There's rarely air conditioning and a fan is typically blowing from a corner of the dining room. noodless MUST be fresh and handmade if not by the owners of the restaurant then by a noodles factory. The ""mouthfeel"" of the noodless is very important - something not unrelated from the term ""al dente"" in Italian cuisine. The rest of the dish tend to vary (broth toppings seasoning). 

Nouilles de Lan Zhou used to only serve beef noodless in three different bowl size and different types of noodless (round or flat). They have since expanded their menu (e.g. cold noodless beef tendon noodless) and added a few side dishes (e.g. edamame and pickled mustard green spicy cucumbers). The regular beef noodless remain my favorite.

The restaurant is located in a weirdly arranged space at the entrace of the G&D supermarket and has probably less than 30 seats. Service is fast and the illustrated menu is helpful to make a choice. It usually goes like this: 1) choice of noodless and if required 2) bowl size 3) type of noodles and 4) spicy or not. Some noodless such as the beef tendon noodles only has one size (medium). Talking about size the portions are humooongous. I don't recommend ordering anything larger than medium if you can't finish e.g. three Big Macs. 

A great place to grab a cheap and quick meal!"
"Best lan zhou noodles I have all these years. I mean not just in Canada. As a Chinese I have not had such a good one in some Chinese cities. 
Good service really good quality. I visited Montreal for three weeks and I came to this place four times."
"Very busy very yummy. Tricky to get a table sometimes... Often. But turnover is pretty quick here. Worth the wait.
They got that beef soup that is simply unrivalled. Get it spiced up. If you have room for a side I dig that cucumber salad with peanuts."
The best Vietnamese restaurant in Southshore.  Service very great and food fresh.  You should go there. Not too salty broth and plenty of tasty stuff for around 10 $. Very good vietnamese Pho noodles. Rice dishes are also awsome. Great new pho place. More authentic than others
Amazing!  The best Thai food I've ever had.  Everything spicy and delicous!  Excellent service.
Great food.  Nice atmosphere.  Attentive service. The Pad Thai and spring rolls were delicious.
"I have no idea why I haven't seen this place before but I'm pretty glad I did! Another handmade noodles and dumpling joint in Montreal! It was about 7:45pm when I go there it was still quite busy so I decided to take my order to go. I will have to come back for a dine-in experience.

I got a spicy handmade noodles soup and the soup was tasty noodless were good but I suspect they would have been much better had I eaten them straight away and the spicy was not a kick-in-the-face spicy but something that warmed the soul. The prices are super and portions were big I split my meal in two! Oh and service! I asked how long it might take and he said less than a minute and I'd say that I got everything in 2 minutes (1 minute and 25 seconds to pack it and take my money!) Looking forward to my second visit!"
My spice beef noodles had good noddle but beef fat. Understand it is makes a nice bouillon but it's not worth what I paid. It's kinda cool to have hot tea ready when you come to the table. The place is fast pace small kitchen with three guys rolling dough and making dishes. My family liked their dishes but mine was simply disastrous. Be careful they may see you are next not local but one day tourist. Recommended to the place- please respect your customer.
"Best hand pulled noodless ever! Perfect for chilly weather with generous portions on soup and noodless. I don't think they add any MSG since I left the restaurant stuffed and thankfully not dehydrated. Make sure to eat the thicker noodless quick because they will get soggy if you don't slurp em up fast enough. 

I got the small combo which comes with a small side dish. I tried the pickled edamame which was a little too street market tasting for me and the cucumbers which were pretty spicy! The pickled edamame went perfect with the soup however so I highly recommend dumping some in your noodles soup for added flavor.

If you're wondering how big of a bowl you should order... definitely no larger than a medium unless you are STARVING."
"Had dinner here. There was a dead winged insect on the imperial roll. I eventually caught the attention of the server. She said ""want [a] change""? New dish of food arrived from the kitchen. Food was all right. My partner ordered beef-- he says it was over-cookea. Poor customer service on their part-- most times a reataurant would at least give the meal for free. Was charged full price on our bill. Bug in food + bad customer service = not going back."
This place is so authentic. The beef noodless are so flavorful and the noodless are springy. The beef shank was seasoned perfectly and not that spicy. All in all this place was excellent.
"Best Vietnamese restaurant by far.  The food was delicious.  I scanned reviews and found Jessica's review and ordered down her list for a perfect meal!!!
The chicken soup with gizzards & liver the raw beef salad and grilled need over noodless.   Awesome!!!
They take cash or debit only!"
Extremely soothing and comforting chicken toniknese soup! The noodles is thick and cooked to perfection and the chicken is lean and flavorful. The Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk is a must.
I give these guys 5 stars. I love my noodless so I may be biased. The food was excellent. There was a line out the door I stood outside for 15 minutes. It was the only place with a line that could have made you want to go somewhere else but I was determined. I got the number one with hand selected beef and the Lan Zhou noodless. The broth was great noodless perfect if I could find something to complain about was the cold egg they put in the soup kinda like cooled the soup but I like my soup hot with a fresh hot boiled egg. Nonetheless no shells in the soup. I will be back especially given I was there for work. I did destroy my broth with what I thought was a soy sauce it was vinegar. Still crushed through it though.
"This place is incredible! I've tried all 3 ""salad"" dishes (edamame spicy cucumber and seaweed potatoes) and of course the amazing beef soup. They even let you choose which size noodless you want. The soup is extremely flavorful and if you like spicy food they have a type of chili oil you can add to it which gives it a wonderful spice. The noodless are handmade and the price is right. Definitely a great pick if ever you're in the Chinatown area and are craving a good soup. The small is a perfect size and the medium is good if you have a bigger appetite or are starving. 
My girlfriend tried the vegetable version of the soup and said the broth tasted a little bit saltier but still very good."
"Came to this restaurant for Mother's Day service was great. Started with a won ton soup and sweet and sour- both were delicious!! Then came the salt and pepper shrimp by far the best dish for me! Then we had the satay beef which was tender and so yummy!! Then we had the three cup chicken was a real crowd pleaser. The service was amazing. For Mother's Day they brought a free glass of wine. Good music
Good vibes
Will for sure  be coming back

I would like the recipe for the salt and pepper shrimp! It was finger licking good!!!"
"saw the pictures of their combo dishes posted by the window; attracted inside.

had the jazz 2 combo which includes a clear broth soup grilled beef and shrimps on skewer over vermicelli and a soda at $11.99. bf had a seafood fried noodles ($9-10?) that didn't look half as good as mine. ""should have tried to pho (under $10) like everybody else"" he said. i agree.

service is good; waiter (boss?) was polite and pleasant. they have a bar w/a good amount of liquors on the shelves but we didn't have any drink from it. as many asian eateries they prefer cash. seems like they either have a surcharge for using credit card or was it debit only? have to ask the person who took care of the bill to verify that."
"I must admit expectations were high b/c of all the rave reviews and after spending a cold rainy day in Montreal I was really really looking forward to an awesome bowl of hot beef soup with hand pulled noodless.  The restaurant is a well run smooth operation with limited options on the menu good/excellent value esp. with the combos with each order made fresh and quickly with good service.  A sure fire recipe for success.  I'm not surprised they are popular - so why disappointed?  In short the food.  First the noodless lacked the chewy goodness (""kew-kew"") I would expect from fresh hand-pulled noodless.  A big bowl of noodless is only great if they are not soft.  In addition the broth was watery - okay flavor but not at all rich in mouth feel.  Lastly the beef while tender barely had any flavor.  The tea egg was good with a nice tea essence (vs soy). Will try a different hand-pulled noodles establishment next time."
"We took the Metro to go to the old town after visiting the St. Joseph's Oratory in the morning.  When we got off the Metro and noticed we were so close to the Chinatown so we tried to eat there.  We followed other people walking towards Chinatown and we went into the fist place because we were so hungry.  We did not check on Yelp for rating.

The place was packed so we took the 1st available seat.  It is ""cash only"".  I ordered #16 wontons noodles soup $5.50 and my daughter ordered #13 steamed Chinese dumplings $7.50.  

The portion of other people was very huge.  Most the people ordered some kind of noodles dish without soup.  A lot people eating at the restaurant by himself/herself.  This is not a place to bring smell kids or family because the seating were super close.

My noodles soup came quickly while the steamed dumpling took a little more time.  My daughter was so impressed by the cook in the back because she had a seat facing the kitchen.  My wonton noodles soup was bland and her Chinese dumplings were not up to standard.  The one you buy from the Chinese grocery frozen food section was a lot better back in Chicago.  I think we did not ordered the right dishes at this place."
Decided to try this place out for lunch on a Sunday. It was packed full but we were seated (party of four) i about 5 minutes. Unfortunately I was disappointed by almost everything: the beef pho broth really lacked in flavour there were barely any noodless and way too much beef. My boyfriend got a chicken and beef pho (with chicken broth) which lacked even more in flavour and tasted as though it had been watered down. The grilled chicken dish was HUGE so that was cool but the chicken didn't taste that great. As well the service wasn't the best not very attentive and not super chaleureux. I did however really like the imperial rolls those were delicious. Will not come back to this place again.
Mehh. This place is definitely below average. The soup is lukewarm the peanut sauce is super watery and the salad rolls are not wrapped well. Had the beef pho and the meat was all fat. Broth didn't have much flavour. Price point is not worth the quality. The service was very callous as well. You'd be better off elsewhere if you're craving pho.
I was walking around Mile End and stumbled upon this cute place. I wanted a light lunch and the veggie spring rolls + Thai coconut curry soup were perfect. The soup was AMAZING. I only tried it because I'm vegan and it's the only soup they have without chicken broth. I'm so glad I tried it! It's also quite cheap and it's very cozy inside. They even have a section where you can sit in cushions on the ground!
Quintessential Cantonese food. Everything is freshly cooked to order. Standard variety of noodles dishes ( get you don't mess with the good old standards). Staff is friendly fast and efficient. Portions are large. We found the noodles dishes to be better than the dim sum.
The Hanan dumplings (peanut butter and chili oil) were . We def recommend that. We also got the wonton noodles soup which was too bland. The soup had no flavor and almost tasted like water. The place is cash Only but accepts USD and they will give you 10% discount on the bill if you pay USD for the exchange rate. Better exchange rate than what you'd get at foreign exchange rate stores!
"Bun Bo Hue (spicy noodles soup with beef) was simply fantastic!  Our daughter had a rice vermicelli bowl with grilled pork and imperial roll which was also amazing.  Everything here is fresh authentic and made from scratch with the best of ingredients.  They certainly don't cut corners and the owner is very passionate about his food.  
This is not a bastardized version of vietnamese cuisine made to appeal to the masses...which is a good thing.  We will go back often this is a wonderful restaurant."
"The service was good. The food was exactly what we expected. There was nothing special but the place is nice and enjoyable. 
We'll come back for another soup if we're in the area."
"Amazing discovery. We got there at 5 (exceptionally early to be somewhere else after) it was already full! By the time we left at 6 there was a line up.
I got the #1 Fish and meat soup. My boyfriend got the Special Tonkinese. Both delicious! I love that the taxes are included in the price. Big portions i got a small and I was so full by the end. We also got a plate of crispy sesame beef. I love that the plate was only beef thats it. I dont care for rice. 2 soups + big plate of beef 32$ tax inc. Amazing.
Cant wait to go back and try all the other things!"
I absolutely loved this place. What a great bowl of pho! I went with the pho tai (rare beef soup). They have 2 sizes: regular ($10) and large ($11.50). The large bowl is great if you have a huge appetite! Lots of noodless and meat in every bowl. And the flavour of the soup was fantastic. Definitely one of the best pho restaurants in the downtown core.
Gorgeous vegan restaurant and friendly service. I can't wait to return! Favorite in Montreal so far.
Great vegetarian food with friendly service. Loved the burrito the salsa was amazing.
So delicious! Great service and reasonably priced. Ample portions. Berber and enjira yum!
I Love their Soupes & Entré's but the fried chicken and beef can be very dry sometimes
Loved the noodless here. Fresh fast service delicious and refreshing and reasonably priced.
A simple menu fresh medium width noodless good beef and broth tastes a medium bowl is already a huge amount for dinner at a great price.   The mixed beef cucumbers cold side dish has very good flavor.  My colleague enjoyed his DanDan noodless but added a lot more hot pepper oil from the condiment tray.
"Yummmmm!!

We came at 8:45 because we arrived in Montreal late but they still took us in! (They close at 9pm).

We order the neuilles jiazhiang (jiajiang men) and soupe de nouilles avec boeuf (noodles soup w/beef).  They were both delicious but I especially liked the jiazhiang men!

The edamame with takana (a japanese pickled vegetable) were good too.

The waiter also asked me if I was Japanese and wanted to practice his Japanese with me :)

Thumbs up for good food and friendly staff!"
Very authentic handcraft traditional Chinese noodless!  Nice clean environment and good service.  Overall so impressive!
Great flavor and broth! Get the original Lan Zhou noodles can't go wrong with that.
"Utterly working-class eating house.  Was briskly greeted and presented with a pot of tea and a menu.  Menu is tiny.  Went with plain beef pho with extra veg.  

Soup arrived quickly.  The flavor was *brilliant*.  The noodless in it had the best texture of any Asian soup noodless I've ever eaten.  Only complaint about the soup was the scarcity of beef.

Choice of four sauces/condiments on the table along with a rack of chopsticks and spoons and an old school napkin-dispenser (wish more places would think of that) caused that I lacked for nothing logistics-wise.   Pleasant meal.

Restroom was a bit dirty but fully-functional. Points for that. You're lucky to get a door that locks in a lot of Chinatown's places.

This is a great place to quickly fuel up your gut with hot food that tastes wonderful.  Leave the Kiton blazer at home and just go in 501s and yesterday's grey hoodie.  And bring CASH.  That's all they'll take."
SIMPLY AMAZING! Great food service and staff! Super clean too! Can't wait to go back!
Love this place. Tasty plates. Friendly service. Nice atmosphere. Whenever I feel like Thai I think Siam...
Service was awful. Waited more than 30 minutes for an appetizer. Never coming here again.
Great dumplings. Convenient location for McGill students. I had the beef and coriander dumplings.
Our noodless and dumplings were delicious and the service was quick and friendly. Unfortunately that didn't compensate for the fly in the bottom of a bowl of soup the hair on a dumpling - or the state of the chopsticks and soup spoons all of which which were coated in a film of grease. In recognition of the food and the fact that the owner apologized and comped the soup I'm giving it three stars but cannot recommend.
We dropped by this noodles place while we visit Montreal. Easily beat all the Northeast city noodles shops in the US very authentic. The texture of the freshly made noodless is extraordinary. Soup and chili oil are also great. We came in at 4:30ish. When we finished around 5 there's already a line of at least 8 parties at the entrance. It would be a great place for a quick lunch if you are ever in the area.
"I can't believe people are lining up for this place.  Its decent but not worthy of a long wait.  The noodless itself are good broth fair and the beef was meh. Kind of what you find in pho.  The medium portion was massive amount of broth.  Service was not great.  I was sitting at bar and tough to get attention of server.  

The other hand rolled noodles place I've been to many times (Shang's in Las Vegas) is way better in every respect so maybe I'm jaded."
Good food but rude service. My boyfriend ordered a LARGE dandan noodles but they gave him a small. We called over the waiter who told him to just eat it since it was too late. Like really? The noodless were good but not amazing so very average experience here.
"I ordered for delivery around 5pm on a Monday.
It came quite faster than I thought (25mins)!
 
Pho Tai Bo Vîen (Rare sliced pieces of beef & beef balls) is what I ordered since it's my classic of all time when I eat Pho!
The broth was awesome except a little too anisy.

Portion is a slightly small for a large.
noodless portion was a tiny bit small too. 
Rare sliced pieces of beef were on the hook! (Really yummy!) good quality!
Beef balls were delicious but only 4 pieces (2 whole pieces cut in halves) 

Hoisin sauce & Sriracha sauce in the same cup. Very small amount I asked for an extra.
Price is a tiny bit expensive for what it is! I would sell it $850 instead of ten

Averge overall for a delivery order!"
Very good chinese food. We had soup rice and noodless and everything was very good. service was quick and pleasant although somewhat businesslike. Prices were cheap too (less than $ 30 for lots of food that we had to take home). I'd come here again.
If u like overpaying .... Then this is the place  for you.  The decor is amazing.  The food.... Not do much!!  Three pieces of chicken in your Tom yum soup ... Size of a rice bowl.  All the meat and tofu in the pad thai was cooked and then deep fried.... It was hard and dry and not much favor.  Mango salad ....stay away....beef salad ....was Not Thai beef.... Don't know what it was.  The red curry chicken was good.  Beef jerky was good but not enough for the price.  Breaded shrimp and wings were good.  Service was mediocre.....waited long time for drinks appetizers and even longer for the entrees. If you are on a date and don't want to talk to them .... Then this is the place .... Loud music and talking. We were practically screaming at each other.
Second time there and loved it again! 2 for 2! Had the spicy beef noodles soup and I loved it. I brought my coworker and he thinks it's the best noodless he has ever had. We watched the guy make the noodless and it's pretty impressive and the Italians have nothing on the Chinese when it comes to noodless. Boots!
"Was strolling along Victoria with the boo and decided to grab a bite at this spot. GREAT IDEA :)

We had the grilled chicken plate (chicken rice salad fish sauce) and the special Bun Bo Hue (a spicy beef noodles soup). Both were quite tasty. I probably would ask them to hold the blood cube next time (just a personal preference) but I didn't mind it too much. 

Service was great feels like a small family place the folks in the neighborhood like to frequent. There was a building alarm that went off a few times which according to the staff happens when someone in the building sets off the fire alarm (from cooking etc). Sadly the restaurant has no control over that. 

Would definitely come back again!!!"
Though it is a small place and looks like a fast food the shop offers first rate beef noodless in authentic Chinese style in North America. There is a similar shop in the same Chinatown but not as good as this one. The separate cold dish of beef is also very good no msg added (yes I can easily taste it and the other noodles shop uses msg)--that's the fundamental difference between fast and non-fast Chinese food.
"Enjoying the first nice weather of the year we decided to take a walk to this place. A lot of good options to choose from. Since the weather was already pretty warm (compared to the recent winter ) I decided not to go with the pho even though it looked really good. Instead I went for the daily special. I took the grilled chicken one.
It comes with a soup. The soup is good but the issue is that the service is too fast that before the soup is done the main meal is already there.
The food is really good and the service is quick making it perfect for lunch."
The food quality is excellent and authentic.  The portions are pretty big.  I really like the hot and sour and corn (egg drop) soup.  It's very tasty.  My fiance likes the corn soup there.  We normally order the spicy calamari and eggplant tofu for us two.  I made reservations for my family of 11 people and they gave good ambiance and fast customer service.  My family like the food and service so much we came back again 2 days after.  We order a lot of different dishes and they were amazing.  First dish finished was the Chinese broccoli and mushrooms.  Favorite dish was the beef stew and orange chicken.  They kids ate the chicken fried rice with no soy sauce.  All 9 dishes was finished!  The price is reasonable and fairly inexpensive.  We loved it.
"""The noodless are why I would come back!""

What time we arrived/Wait time?
Arrived at 6:30pm Saturday night and it was full. Had to wait 10 minutes!

Atmosphere?
The atmosphere isn't super fancy. Not the cleanest but it isn't too bad. 

Service/Staff?
The staff was decent. The were more about efficiency and you have to share tables with strangers sometimes.

Food/Menu/Pricing?
The food is great! Very good to have this soup and noodless on a rainy day. The noodless were so addicting and fresh. The soup was good too. I love that you can customize your noodles sizes and it was just a great meal. Good cheap price too!"
"A huge bummer that they ran out of the famed beef tendon soup when I got there Sunday evening so go there on Saturday as early as you can! 

The cucumber like most reviewers said aren't that good but that's just a small side dish anyway. Lacks salt and spice. The special beef noodles soup is out of this world though. The broth first of all is so hearty and flavorful. I ordered the 2nd smallest circular noodless and thought it was still slightly big. I'd go with the smallest noodless or the smallest flat noodless just based on texture. The taste is so good though. 

Also when you walk in the bowls that you think are the Large bowls are actually Medium! I'm a big eater but the medium bowl was more than enough. Serving portions are huge!! There was a line out the door but it goes by quickly especially with smaller parties."
Service was snappy and the food was great. The noodles soup is fantastic - i ordered a Medium and couldn't finish it. I'm amazed at the folks who could finish a large bowl. I asked the waiter if I should order the extra beef and he was honest enough to recommend that I wait and see if the beef portion in my stew was enough (it was more than enough!). I don't speak French but I wish the waiter had told us that you could change the thickness of the noodless and even order flat ones. We sat by the bar and could watch the noodless being made which was very entertaining. I wish the waitress was more attentive with the waters though. All in all a great Chinese food experience in Montreal!
Food wasn't bad but service was not great. Not sure if the language barrier made it harder but the server was quite rude. My daughter did enjoy her noodless and service was quick. Not good for large groups as it is a small place
Best noodles place in town. If you haven't been there yet you must go. Very simple menu but great great food! The noodless are chewy and the meat is tender. It's great on a cold night and they have cold soup in the summer.
Super relaxed atmosphere and delicious food what more can you ask for? My friends and I had dinner there and gabbed for hours without any pressure to move it along. Was not super busy on a weeknight but it's always nice to have great service (refilling of water) even after all the main meal is consumed. Everything we tried was super tasty (both soups of the day -- a tomato soup and a creamy squash soup Northern lights sandwich pepper island sandwich chocolate cheesecake and carrot cake) and very generous portions. Will definitely be back!!
Best beef noodles soup ever! After a cold day of hiking in the snow we were ready for a hot bowl of broth and noodless. First the noodless are hand pulled right at the window #Authentic. You get to choose your noodless size/thickness and shape. There's different bowl sizes I went for the medium and its pretty sizable. We ordered the beef bowl with chili oil (omg yes please). The place is pretty small so there may be a wait and the menu only contained a few signature items. Each bowl is made to order so there's true freshness. The broth was perfect and just the perfect thing to soothe your cold soul.
So so so so good!! I was expecting a long wait for a Saturday but there were just 8 people ahead of us and the line moved very quickly. We were seated within 5 minutes. We decided on the Dan Dan noodless and the beef tendon soup since it's only available on weekends. I loved that we could pick the size of the noodless! There were about 8 different sizes to pick from from very thin like spaghetti to very wide. The Dan Dan noodless were fantastic the spice level was perfect. The beef tendon soup was also excellent. I really loved the broth.  Highly recommend this place!
"Great little restaurant in chinatown. They make their own noodless and let me tell you they are AMAZING !!!
I took the beef soup the broth was very simple and light just the way I like it. It goes perfectly with the huge amount of noodless they give !! 
The portions are very big. I took a medium sized soup and it was pretty huge (I finished it though because it was sooo good!!) 
I can't wait for my next visit!"
Definitely worth the wait. When we saw the line at this place while walking through China town we figured it was probably good. We ended up waiting 15 minutes. Got the Dan dan noodless and beef noodles soup. Both were so flavorful. noodless were amazing. As others have mentioned the restaurant itself didn't have the most amazing ambiance. But for $10 for a bowl of delicious noodless I honestly don't care what the place looks like. If I lived in Montreal I would come here over and over again.
"Excellent soup yes there is only one choice ""beef broth"" but who needs more. Their small size is pretty generous. We went with our 6 years old son and were a little worried about the lack of options but to our surprise he liked it so much he said ""I wish I could swim in this soup"" followed by "" can we come back here next time we come to Canada?"". I ordered their noodless in their smallest version my husband ordered their recommended size (medium) I will stick with the smaller version they are just more fun to eat!!!"
I like this spot but the service was a bit curt.  I like the large bread sandwiches especially when walking on a cold day.  The sandwich soup special is a great deal for a filling meal.  Free wifi is easy with no password to deal with.  I'll definitely go back after a walk through Park Mont Royal
Pretty good??Food are indeed chinese style?I love beef and chicken?4 stars???I love it?
Worse service worse vegi food in Montreal...poor attitude.overpriced for what you get.
Excellent food  good service. We ordered burrito  nachos and quesadilla all food was delicious
Excellent thai food! Fantastic service. Good quality ingredients. The sizzling seafood platter was to die for!
Great place we stumbled upon after roaming around the St.Catherines/Crescent area in Montreal. Crispy beef appetizer was a bit overdone (maybe cut the beef thinner?) but the flavor was outstanding. We ordered two entrees - green curry chicken and chicken with cashews and both were excellent. Skipped dessert.
Great salads. I had the 'Habibi' one. Lot of variety to choose from. Friendly service as well.
Delicious soup dumplings with the right amount of savory broth. If you really read the reviews carefully the food reviews are positive but some yelpers whine about everything from the service decir and their mood like some sort of expert food critics. Solid 4 stars.
5 stars for excellent service and being kind people. Will certainly come back to try the food.
A very popular place to eat Traditional Chinese beef noodless Lol good appetizers and Zha JIANG mian
Went tonight  food was delicious! And best won ton broth ive ever had. The service great!
"The sizes of the soups are really good. But me I love meat and to me not enough meat in the soups and if you want extra of course it coats more. My father ordered a soup that had tripe in it but when he got the soup it was so thinly sliced which  is good but not enough at all more it was of a garnish than main meat in the soup so that was very disappointing.

I like a sea food pho that consist of shrimp Squid rings and so forth they seem not to have that kind of soup I know they have shrimp and or crab but it's more of a garnish than a main protein in the soup.  
 But over all my pho is really good their sandwiches are to die for. But more meat in their soups would be recommended."
This is not Nouilles de Lan Zhao but what can you expect in a mall food court. For $12 we bought #4 to share with extra veggies a considerably smaller less tasty and less-well cooked version of the beef tendon soup at Nouilles. Nudo noodless are hand-pulled but with considerably less craftsmanship and style than Nouilles they're not as tasty and seemed a little under-cooked. Beef was cooked but not to the melting tenderness of Nouilles. Save your appetite for the real deal!
"I tried the new cold noodles but didn't enjoy it due to sauce tasted like mayonnaise than typical peanut sauce.   My husband had the noodles with meat sauce and was way too salty.  
Place is nice and clean and staffs are friendly but food was ok."
Came here with a friend for an excellent Vietnamese lunch!  First we ordered the organs (tendon heart liver ...I know some FrancoAnglo people will think gross but asians love it!!) in cilantro/onions.  Then I had a rare beef pho!  Amazing broth and very quick service and quality!  Washed it down with a vietnamese coffee!!  Awesome!  Gotta come here again!!!!
"Nondescript from the outside the food here is some of the best Vietnamese in a metropolitan area boasting a multitude of such restaurants. The pho broth is robust savoury and rich. The noodless are always perfectly cooked. Spring rolls are crisp and not greasy. Try the beef stew noodles soup; not many restaurants offer it and MC offers the best I have tasted anywhere. Too bad the cute cashier won't even make eye contact with me."
"The service was indifferent almost annoyed we were there. Had to ask for attention and service despite few occupied tables. 
Beef was good but the veggie hot pot was bland.  
Asked for chili oil and the waiter pointed to the generic red sauce that looked like ketchup.  
As a parting shot they included the tip in the charge even though we were only a party of 3. 
It's Montreal there's so many better options even just down the block in Chinatown.   Skip this one."
This is one of the better Pho houses I've been to in Montreal.   Like my fellow yelpers said the soup broth is full of flavor and the service is prompt and fast.    I've had the Bun which is like pho (soup) but without the broth inside.  You get fish sauce on the side to pour it in your bowl.   What more can I ask for?!  Be prepared to wait Sat and Sun (lunch) unless you go a bit early.   Enjoy!
"One of my favourite sandwich spots!! The outdoor patio is perfect for the current weather!!! 
This time we ordered the Roast Beef with Blue Cheese Sandwich and their signature Killer Tomato Sandwich. 
The ingredients always taste fresh and servings are huge. Service is great."
Delicious soup. My friends' meals looked amazing. I can't have gluten and I don't eat meat so my meal was less good as the pleasure of this place really seems to be in the meat and the noodless! The tea egg was incredibly delicious. Great service.
Small place--elbow to elbow--but WOW so worth it! Ate here on a whim because a friend recommended it and it did not disappoint. Even if it's hot af outside I would still recommend eating here. Best noodles soup I've ever had. Do it.
I expected too much. The service was good. but the food was bit disappointed. eeg roll was really good but asparagus crab meat soup and sweet and sour chicken were not what I expected. they used canned asparagus and artificial crab meat.
"A random stop in the small Chinatown in Montreal led us here- we were drawn by the no-frills attitude lack of English and French service and window display where noodless were being made to order in addition to the random location above the escalator to a grocery store.

There are not many seats and consequently we waited about 30 minutes to be seated as a party of 4 but I would say that it was certainly worth the wait.

Something unique about this place is that you can choose the type of noodless that you would like and this ranges from both the type of noodles (round or flat) as well as the thickness. It's worth noting that your noodless are actually just one long noodles!!

My friend got the Dan Dan noodless which she said were reminiscent of her home back in China- to which our other Chinese friend agreed strongly with. I got the Beef noodles Special with thick flat noodless as did my friend- it hit the spot on this cold day and was super flavorful with the spicy chili oil in addition to a rich broth and slices of beef.

I'm glad we randomly stopped by and I would certainly recommend this to friends."
The noodless were fresh and handmade. As with all handmade noodless they have a good bite to it. I would've liked the noodless a little chewier but it's still a lot better than dried or refrigerated noodless you buy in the supermarkets. The soup for the beef noodless tasted a little bland. Surprisingly I liked the soup of veggie noodless better. It has a nutty taste and reminded me of Thai curry. Portions are large.
perfect ramen in Montreal this taste make me recall my childhood memory. It have not ever happen when I eat in restaurant in Canada! I've ordered a medium bowl of beef ramen I thought I could finish but not when I packed it home and eat next day for breakfast the noodles is still pretty good!
"I have to admit I got in thinking I'd have an average meal; I was mentally ready. I have to say I was pleasantly pleased. Not that it's the most authentic place. I ordered the lemongrass beef and it was quite all right. Service was nice and friendly."
Dishes are not salty but flavourful and unlike many other chinese restos you don't have to drink litres of water after dining here. Weekend special spicy beef soup stole my heart. Even simple steamed rice is good because they use jasmine rice and cook right (well anyone hates flavourless rice cooked with too much water? That's a turnoff.)
"After wondering around Chinatown we decided to grab a quick Vietnamese food. We decided to try pho bac. Only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because their service was fast.

I have to say it was the worst Vietnamese food I had 
in my entire life!!! We both ordered beef vermicelli
bowl. The serving was small and the beef was so tough that we could not chew and had to spit it out. 

It was the most disappointing meal!!!!"
"Located right on St Laurent in the heart of Chinatown above a grocery store. 

This places makes me feel at home. Authentic pulled noodles with a rich deep beef broth. I crave this all the time it's especially delicious in the cold fall and winter. 

The major draw as you're walking passed is seeing the noodless getting pulled. You can choose the size and shape of your noodles whatever suits your palette. 

I usually get the large round noodless. There are also combos that come with a small salad - spicy cucumber (super good and fresh) potato and seaweed (not as good as cucumber but still nice) and there's a last one I can't recall. They also have cured beef plates which remind me of home. If you run out of noodless you can ask for more for a small price! 

There's usually a line so be prepared for that but it's well worth the wait! Service is also pretty fast. I like to get a big bowl of noodless and bring it home for lunch over a few days. 

In my opinion this place is better than Nudo and certainly feels more authentic!"
No AC no ICE on the hot day! Not a big fan already. Service just like a fast food chain. I could understand to the service why they don't have too much thought into servicing their customers because it's quite busy due to not enough seats but tips it's on demand? You are required to pay tips even if you like it or not. Well I am not so big fan of that. The broth is not as tasteful as it look in the picture. Gotta say noodles is handmade and that is the only special about it. Everything else is decent and definitely not worth it. This is a mediocre noodles. Don't expect much but at least it fill your stomach for a day.
"I'd had Lan Zou style Lamen (La = pulled Men = noodles) before several times in Asia and Montreal. This is definitely not the real deal but the lack of authenticity aside (I don't judge food by its authenticity; I grew up with and love General Tao and Butter Chicken).

The noodless are not very good. They are hand-made for sure but so are the noodless from Nudo 2 minutes away Yuki Lamen (sp?) at Concordia's Faubourg and that one Lamen shop at Eaton Center's food court and frankly it's not very good or fresh here.

The seating is atrocious here. It's very cramped since it's a semi-open area to the outside flies is a problem in summer and the extreme coldness is a problem in winter. Plus the floor  are just disgusting. The tables aren't very clean either you'll most likely get your winter jacket and/or shirt dirtied.

The soup stock is itself is very watered down and tasted mainly... I dunno how to describe the flavor that only chemically constituted beef bouillon cube can provide. You might make better beef stock with half chemical flavoring and half real meat and/or bone at home.

TL;DR:
Meh noodles bad soup extremely back setting. Good proximity to the metro much better options including other Lan Zhou style Lamen to be had within 3 minutes walking distance."
"This is one of those rare places that really lives up to the the reviews. The noodless were incredibly fresh tender flavorful etc and were a genuine highlight of my trip to Montreal. The pickles were also delicious and a nice complement to the meatiness of the main beef dish. The service was friendly and helpful; they guided me towards the right noodles thickness and I liked their suggestion."
"Upon entering wondered why for such a casual place did we need reservations?

The menu using many photos might suggest would be easy to navigate not. There were several menu items that had no prices?
We started with the special wonton soup (not) and the Seaweed and egg drop soup (reasonable) the portion size was small as were all the plates except the Curry Beef dumplings.

Here's a question why were half of the Curry Beef dumplings sour and the other not? The beef in the dumplings must have been half fat was when bitten into a good spoonful of grease poured out.

The homemade noodles with pork were contained both bean sprouts and shredded cucumber so there was a puddle under the noodless which tasteless despite the addition of the chilly oil and soy sauce.

Whether or not one is accustomed to these flavours is not so much the point as the lack of flavour. The red bean soup is meant to be dessert = sweet (not) even the rice flour dumplings in the soup had no sugar.

In all the plates there was no use of salt or seasonings. The meal was a major letdown as were the scary dirty bathroom with an overhead fan that made so much noise it shook the fillings in your teeth.

Two words - no value. Not going back there.

For  1/2 to 1/3 the price a much more gratifying meal can be had in a handful in restaurants in Chinatown."
Interesting menu and good food. I like the service also waiters are always polite. I highly recommend this place.
One of my fave thai restaurants. Authentic food clean restaurant and great service! I could eat here weekly!!
Amazing service (Naomi & Jessica) they made great recommendations and the bowl of Seoul makes my soul complete!
Tiny hole in the wall restaurant above a grocery store. You can see employees running down to get groceries which is interesting haha cramped as if you're eating in China not saying that's a bad thing at all! I took one star away cause it was so hot in there you couldn't fully enjoy the food. Makes service really efficient! Had the beef brisket noodles which is one size and that size is LARGE I ate as much as I could and it's as if I ate nothing at all but at least we could take it home. My boyfriend got the vegetarian one and it tasted pretty good. The cold spicy cucumber was good! And price is not bad for the amount of food. Next time I would want to try the original beef noodless
The best soup and spring roll in Montreal. Rated 4 stars because the wasrooms are disgusting.
I was visiting from Texas. Now I'm back and I can't stop thinking about that raw beef salad! So delicious!!
really good food with quick service. i highly recommend their pho ga and their bbq pork.
Absolutely delicious curries appetizers soups sauces and deserts. Excellent service too! not cheap but definitely worth it!!
Nice place the Tonkinese Soup was pretty good. Full of MSG...head was pounding afterwards.
Really good calamari great service. 50% off drinks on sundays. Nice ambiance. Terasse is nice
Cool place.  Most seating is counter service so not terrific for larger groups but fun to interact with the chefs and bartenders while you eat/drink. For is great cocktails are great service is relatively quick.  Remember 18 and up so cannot bring the kids.  Not a bad thing.
"What to add to the long list of this noodles and beef broth soup spots accolades!? 

the point: today being New Years Day.... LONG FRESH HAND PULLED noodless for an auspiciously long healthy and prosperous life and red monkey year. Red Monkey is said to be prosperous for small businesses so happy to appease the plucky celestial primate.

...shivering when I arrived and fortified for the stroll all the way back to Mile End afterwards.  Umm so yesh happy comfort camper."
The pho was delicious here. We ordered the beef ball pho and rare beef/flank pho. The broth was very tasty and flavourful. The meats were good quality. Especially for the beef balls the texture was soft and free of tendons. The only downside is the size is small for the price you pay.
Great food great prices and great service. The servers here are very friendly and accommodating. Service was quick and food tastes great. Would recommend this place to anyone who wants great Chinese food in MTL. :)
"Just look for the tourists standing outside the window watching the chefs pull their noodless!

Now this is a damn fine bowl of soup. Savoury broth and deliciously chewy noodless. Soup bowls are enormous so show up hungry or just order a small. Make sure to add a healthy splash of black vinegar before you start slurping. Enjoy."
"35 star
Staying at Le Nouvel Hotel. Very fast delivery nice delivery guy.
Food is good but not great  classic menu 
noodles were good but a bit too dry
Soup was thick but pretty tasty
Vegetable mix was average...
White rice is ok

Good solution for quick dinner at a fair price"
"We ordered hand-pulled beef noodless Cantonese chow mein and pan fried dumplings. All dishes were delicious and authentic. And no MSG!
We will definitely come back to this restaurant whenever we come back to Montreal. Service was very attentive and great with our kids. Our daughter loved the dipping sauce for the dumplings and the waiter just brought her another bowl of dipping sauce. Very thoughtful.  Restaurant is very small but service is quick and so the wait won't be long."
"I really loved the authentic noodless at Nouilles de Lan Zhou. I love how you get to choose between 7 different styles of freshly hand pulled noodless. I ordered the thin flat noodless and my girlfriend ordered the super thin round noodless which were as thin as angel hair pasta; I really liked both styles. I was very full from the medium sized bowl. I did like the beef tendon bowl a lot more than the braised beef bowl. The braised beef slices were very bland to me. The beef broth was delicious and had great depth of flavor. The beef tendon bowl was spicy but not too oily just the way I like. My only complaint is that the restaurant space is really poor. The Restraunt is basically the first floor of an Asian supermarket downstairs and the space is very cramp with no place to hang your coat."
"This place has very good reviews in Montreal Chinatown. I went here with my family during our trip to Montreal.

Taste: average
Portion: very big
Warning: the big bowl here is very big serves 2 people.

We each ordered a bowl of noodles soup. I ordered small which is still a lot for me. My husband ordered a large one and omg it is super big he was super full afterward.
I think the taste is just so-so it is just typical lan zhou noodles soup.
Also one the of dish we got had a bug. Even though the server exchanged a new one for us but I started to question the cleanliness of the kitchen.
It is definitely a fill-you-up place in Chinatown with average food. However I don't think I would come back here when I visited Montreal Chinatown."
Horrible service. Water came 15 minutes after we were sitting. The rice and the noodless came 10 minutes after the main entry . The noodless were hard and under cook . Please avoid the service here !!!! Full of actitude
My partner and I found the noodless were good. We were just disappointed we didn't order the thicker noodles. The waiter didn't offer they basically just took our order and assumed that we wanted the regular noodles If we didn't  ask. You definitely have to know your noodless before you ordered. The noodles came out pretty quick and  was very good . Will come back again and definitely order the thicker noodless :D
It was a rainy day as my family and I walked through Montreal's Chinatown looking for something to eat. This noodles house stood out as it had a decent amount of solid reviews and since it was raining noodless seemed fitting. Rest assured I was not disappointed with my decision as the Beef noodles Soup I ordered was made to perfection! The noodless were handmade right there in the store and they gave you 5 different levels of thickness that you can choose for your noodless. Personally I think that getting the noodless on the thicker side will allow you to get a better taste of how fresh those noodless are! The broth and the meat all tasted extremely authentic as well so I left the store as a happy and satisfied customer!
"I was wandering through Montreal trying to kill time (and also got a bit hungry as it was around lunchtime) so finding some generally positive reviews on Yelp I decided to try Nu-Do.

As people before me have said the big draw to this place was that they have hand-pulled noodless.  I really liked how their noodless were made to order; the noodles guy came out from around back to make the noodless as I finished ordering.  This guy was by no means an expert noodles-puller (an expert would've been much faster) but they were cooked just right (not too mushy and not undercooked) and the beef was also very well cooked.  The soup has gotten many compliments here but it seemed pretty standard to me - however I did like that it is less salty than most other places so you can really pick out other flavours in the broth.

Portion size-wise I thought it was a perfect size: just enough to make you feel satisfied without being overly full.

As others have also touched on the only drawback was the wait.  I went on a Friday afternoon (about 1:30pm so after the lunch rush) and still had to wait a bit before I could eat - on the one hand it's understandable because it's made to order but it's also in a food court so you would expect a bit more expediency in the food prep.  After I had ordered and before I got my food there was a sizeable crowd of people also waiting...I can't imagine how they deal with an actual lunchtime crowd!

Price-wise I paid a bit over $10 for a bowl of beef noodles soup.

Overall though it's a good place to eat if you want something tasty not super-filling and have a bit of time to spare."
"Doesn't look like much from the outside or inside but I've been coming here since I was a teen 25 years ago) with my dad when we wanted a large delicious soup or not hungry enough for shabu shabu across the street I hadn't been in about 5 years and never with hubby or the kids. My husband walked right in as I figured out the parking situation the kids 10 and 12 were more hesitant (kids raised in the suburbs....). The menu is straight forward lots of options but very much the same. I took the number 5 soup rare beef flank brisket tripe and tendon. I only eat that soup here and it was as usual perfect. I took the medium and had planned to take half home....yeah didn't happen. The other three took rouleau printanier (uncooked shrimp rolls) and the rice with meat one had beef one pork and one shrimp. There was silence and very little discussion until my youngest said ""this is sooo good!"". It's now his fourth fav resto!  Well done staying so good for so long!"
"I believe I was there over four years ago.... The food tasted better from what I remember. Today the food quality has gone down. 

We went to get the beef with veggies and the papaya salads. Meh... I will spend my money on Siam instead. 

Customer service isnt the best but they were fast."
"Amazing food and very good service!!!!

The location is good.

Brand new decoration with comfortable seat!"
Authentic chinese!!!! Confirmed by chinese lol. Braised pork with sweet potato noodles is my favorite. Amazing!!!
Went for lunch. Great food and excellent service. Had the gnocchi. Portion looked small but was very filling.
"So basic... and so expensive...
Really bad service... the kids that work there just dont care..."
I'll keep it simple. It's winter it's cold... I want soup and Pho Bac 97 is my go-to pho place. Go for the beef pho with tribe with the classic ingredients: tendon tripe &meatballs. Because I only go there with one dish in mind I am always satisfied.
great chicken broth very different from all the other pho i had which is usually a beef broth.
Great food at great value. Only issue is that the service is crazy slow.
Great food and service. Love the Zen decor. Can not wait for the terrase to open.
Very polite and nice service. My first time thai foods experience so can't judge too much but ok.
"not impressed. 

we waited about 25-30 minutes in line outside and i guess that added to our expectations. but i mean if people are going to stand in line for this place it SHOULD live up to the expectation no? 

we got the beef noodless in 2 styles of noodles: moxi (thinnest round) and da quan (widest flat). i'm a big fan of hand pulled noodless because they tend to have a much nicer glutinous chewy texture. but these were not that. the moxi had zero toothsomeness you may as well be biting into air. the da quan had more chew but not much; i found it a little gummy to be honest. the broth for the beef noodless was... fine. a little weak in my opinion but i guess i just prefer a really rich beefy flavor. the chili oil had the numby kind of spice by the way. the smalls were more than enough noodles for a lunch-sized portion. we also got a small dan dan to try which had a thicker round noodles and dang was that disappointing. that was the gummiest noodles i've ever eaten in my life. the minced pork sauce was great but ruined by that gummy gummy noodles. i hated it. 

it's super crowded as others have mentioned. got there around 2p on a saturday waited in line ate left around 3p and the line was still long. i personally would not wait in line for this ever again. if there was zero line and i was craving noodless and i just happened to be right in front of it then i'd eat it. otherwise try elsewhere. i personally wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way for this."
"We ate lunch here after visting Marché Jean-Talon (market).

There is seating outside in front and back. We sat in the outside in the back.

We ordered:

Appetizer: Beef tartar - this was good comes with onion peanuts and fried rice crackers to eat with beef
pho - this was not very good. Soup was a bit bland.
Vermincelli with shrimp shewers and pork chop - this was much better than the pho. It also comes with a good amount of mint bean sprouds asian basel.

They don't take credit card like most asian places."
THIS. PLACE. LIVES. UP. TO. THE. HYPEEEE. I was in Montreal for 3 full days and came here twice. This place was easily one of the highlights of my trip. (Living in Miami I don't have access to legitimate noodles joints so maybe that's why I'm so excited about this place....) Their signature is the Lan Zhou beef noodles soup. You get to choose the thickness and shape of the noodles that are made fresh to order right at the glass window. Their kitchen is completely open--so you know you're getting quality. As I sat there waiting for my food I could hear them calling out the orders and noodles styles for the chef to hand pull them to order. I like to get wide noodless because they have more chew and indeed they were very chewy and perfectly cooked. The prices are very reasonable and I could barely finish a small bowl so definitely go a size down if you're unsure what size to get! The establishment is the upstairs area to an asian market downstairs so the space is very cramped...don't come here with the expectation of fine dining but know that you are going to get a bomb bowl of noodless (even better if on a cold day!) note: they DO take credit card!
"wasn't bad but wasn't great.

the stir fried handmade noodless would make us come back again and again if we lived in Montreal. the veggie steamed dumplings and wonton noodles soup would not. the steamed dumplings lacked something and it wasn't because it was a veggie and lacked pork or shrimp. we've had great veggie dumplings before and this wasn't the best. the noodless in the wonton soup were good it was fresh and al dente as well as the pork wonton which had a very petally wrapper... but the broth had no flavor of onions chicken broth white pepper... nothing. 

below avg or average soup broth requires a dip into the spice tray (chili oil white pepper etc...) but a great broth its great on its own. the good thing i didn't have to wait too long to have a second shot at the greatest broth on earth it just wasn't in the noodles factory."
Fresh made noodless. You can decide the thickness when you order. We tried the small dan dan noodless and the infamous beef tendon noodles soup. noodless tasted great and the broth was flavorful and delicious. It is not as spicy as you think it is so if you like your food spicy you should ask for extra spicy. The space is pretty tight but looked like tables turnover pretty fast so you shouldn't have to wait too long.
"Don't blink! You will walk pass this homemade noodles house! This place has limited seating as it is located above an Asian grocery market!  Talk about fresh veggies delivered to their door!  Well if you were walking slowly and notice a crowd standing at the window staring you'd realize hand pulled noodless being put on for show!  

Anyways the noodless were delicious! Hand made hand pulled noodless are the softest noodless you will ever get! We got the spicy beef noodless and let me tell you...the aroma just makes your mouth water! The tender beef combined in a savory broth veggies and hand made noodless is the perfect dish for a cold wintery day! Heck if I could I would eat it everyday!! 

You should not visit this little china town without making a stop at this noodles house!!!"
"Another spot in Chinatown where you can get your hand pulled noodles fix. Look for the grocery store (Marché G&D)/all the people peering into the glass window watching the noodles master in awe. 

Both times there was a line to grab a table. The inside is small with two seats at the noodles bar and about 30 seats for the rest.

The menu is short and sweet (less than 10 items). Again the menu out front is different than the one they give you inside. Look for the combo option!

Trip #1
I dropped in Sunday for a pre-dinner and was surprised to see it packed.
- Lan Zhou special beef noodless combo ($10.97 small) - you choose a side get a tea egg and spiciness. I picked the spicy cucumber salad which had a satisfyingly crunchy bite and touch of heat. The noodless were fresh chewy and toothsome. Broth was clean tasting and homey. Think simplicity; they let the noodless shine.

Trip #2
Second time we dropped in on a Tuesday evening (around 7:00pm).
- Lan Zhou special beef noodless combo ($10.97 small)
- noodles with homemade pork sauce ($10.99) - noodless are homemade and again toothsome bite. Crazy amount in one bowl (it's a medium). Pork was way too salty.

Still a solid spot in my books to get hand pulled noodless. Debit and cash only."
"We took the advice of our hotel and glad we did.

When you sit down you get a pot of hot tea and they keep it coming.

The portions were huge for lunch and it comes with soup.

Service was quick and friendly.

Great selection for what ever your protein needs."
The dishes were delicious and crafted with great care. This Thai restaurant definitely delivered in flavor and excellent service. Papaya salad had a nice crunchy spicy sour taste. The Thai iced teas were just the right amount of sweet but the tea taste still came through. The chicken tom yum was full of tasty ingriedients although the size was a bit small. The pad kee mow was also good flavor-wise but they chose to make it with a thinner noodles which was an odd choice for a traditionally wider noodles dish. Lastly the neur nor my had an excellent light curry taste. The bamboo and the beef were extra tender and absorbed the flavor well. I would highly recommend this Thai place for lunch.
We felt a little bit out of place here...but the beef noodles soup was delicious and the portions were huge. My husband and I ordered the medium bowl and I couldn't finish it (my husband did). The ingredients were so fresh the beef was so tender...very good! We were a little confused about the drink situation. They brought us two cups of tea automatically but I was unclear whether we could have ordered different drinks. There was a pitcher of water on the table with a lemon slice floating in it but we didn't have glasses to put the water in so I chugged my tea and poured the water in my cup. Overall it was a good experience...
I had curry vegetables grilled beef and imperial rolls. Everything tastes good and the fish sauce was not too strong. My only possible criticism is the grilled beef could have been thicker and it took awhile before my food arrived.  I'd definitely come back to try the other dishes on the menu.
My wife and I had the pleasure of dining at Pick Thai while in Montreal last week.  Service and food were awesome. We had the Seafood Soup Chicken Pad Thai and Mango Rice desert. Best Thai we have ever eaten.  Will eat here again when we get back to Montreal. Enjoy!
"Fun experience in Montreal as the cook pulls the noodless from dough for your dish right in front of the window. A noodles show!

The restaurant is incredibly small and only a few tables to sit at but plenty of space at the bar if you're dining solo.

I had the small vegetable noodles dish combo which came with edamame and 'preserved vegetables.' The main soup dish was a little bland until we added soy sauce and chili peppers but all in all a delicious meal and a fun experience."
Authentic! I can proudly say that as Chinese. It's very fulfilling as the broth is flavorful but not overly rich. The noodless are super fresh and cooked just to the right tenderness. HUGE servings so you might wanna clear up some space in the stomach before going. The beef stew soup noodles I'd amazing but only available on the weekend I think. All taste pretty good though! One of the very few authentic taste of China in town. Place is aways crowded as it isn't big. Go early for lunch if you don't want to wait in line.
"Ordered through Uber eats for delivery and this was the first time I haven't been disappointed with Chinese food delivery in a long time!

We ordered:
General tao beef and brocoli fried noodless with mixed vegetables a wonton soup a sweet and sour soup and an order of spring rolls. 

Wonton soup was delish. All three mains were very tasty and good portions. Finally I got chicken that wasn't overbreaded! I was very pleased. The only disappointment was the spring rolls which were tiny and bland. I'm not sure if they were fresh.

One issue I've had when ordering Chinese is that the boxes aren't always sealed and it becomes an oily mess everywhere. This place uses reusable plastic containers for the most part which avoids mess and is better for the environment.

One thing I wish they had is full meal options (ex. Soup egg roll and mains as a package deal). Ordering individual dishes gets a bit expensive! It was 60$ for everything which isn't so bad and I had a lunch for the next day. However for orders for bigger groups ordering individual dishes may not be worthwhile.

Overall very good! 4.5 stars"
"I'm someone who honestly doesn't care about the service much(unless it's notably bad) I'm just there for the food. Which is why I gave this place a 4 star because the noodles soup was imo amazing the portion was big despite the fact that I ordered a small. The service is extremely fast you'll get your food in no time. 

But the place is tiny and it reflects on the service a lot it doesn't bother me but I imagine it could bother some people and is important to anyone who plans on coming here. This really isn't a regular restaurant it's food first everything else second. It's more like a food stall with seats; you eat you pay you leave. I think there's like 2 tables that seats 4 people sometimes you end up being seated right next to strangers. So if you're expecting a nice comfortable restaurant you're looking at the wrong place. They do have a take out option.

I also noticed most of the people that were eating there would leave as soon as they were done so this kind of ""restaurant"" is normal to the regulars."
We arrived pretty late to the city of Montreal after a long drive from the States. This was the only place that was open in the vicinity of our hotel. When we arrived the ordering sheet and menus were kind of tossed at us and we were left to write down our orders. When the food did come out it was pretty great not too oily as some Chinese food can be. I got the beef noodles soup and some General Tso's chicken. They were excellent.
The best Chinese restaurant in Chinatown probably the best on the island. Diverse choice of dishes. 2 favs: Love the spicy green beans and the salt and pepper shrimp. Second floor with clean good customer service. Yes good customer service in Chinatown. I swear.
Delicious vegan fare in a bright but cozy not antiseptic atmosphere with friendly service. A bit pricey for the portion sizes.
Cash only establishment. Family owned. Good comfort food very fast service. Just what we needed on a rainy cold night.
"Super delicious freshly made noodless! Texture is great and you have many choices for the thickness of the noodles (5 levels?). I think the thin or 2nd level thickness were the best. We tried the thickest level and thought that was too thick. 

The line easily gets long however it moves fast since service is quick. You get your food within minutes of ordering. Only limiting factor is how fast each customer eats. 

The beef noodles is the best item with a clear broth that is very flavorful. You can select to get spicy or nonspicy. I was also loving the marinated edamame. The spicy cucumber was just ok. 

I tried the vegetables broth and it wasn't that good. The noodles is still nicely al dente! 

They take credit card located in Chinatown above a Chinese market. 
Sitting next to the bar was a nice treat as we got to watch them make the noodless. 

It's Michelin bib gourmand. 
It's cheap quick and delicious! We came back one more time during our short trip in Montreal."
I never knew a soup could be so flavorful! I had the spicy beef with wide flat noodless and it was amazing! Unless you are a competitive eating champion I do not recommend getting a size larger than a medium. I had the small and it was almost too big to finish. If you're looking for delicious fresh cheap filling food in Montreal this is the place!
If you are looking for great pho in Montreal this is the place. Excellent service and even better food!
One of the best sushi I have tried including in Japan. Very nice setting and good service. Definitely a must go.
"Pretty good place to go to on the way to G&D (my favorite grocery store in Chinatown) especially if it's snowing out and you're REALLY hungry. 

Portion sizes are huge I would recommend getting a small portion pretty much no matter what. I got the beef tendon soup which was huge for the price of $10.99++ and I couldn't even finish it! Beef was really good and tender and the soup was super tasty. The noodless were well made good amount of chewiness but I didn't manage to finish them. Nothing was really super special about this restaurant but I could see myself coming here if I was nearby.

I can appreciate the authenticity of this restaurant brings me back to Asia for sure. Its also cool to see groceries coming straight from downstairs to be used in the restaurant! Confirms that everything's fresh :)"
"Legit and fresh Chinese food. 

I come from Vancouver where we have a very very large Chinese population so I compare my experiences from Asian restaurants there.

Great food and good service for an Asian restaurant. There's a difference in service by cultural standards so most western people don't understand that their food may come out at different times and to share their plates family style. 

We had some wonton soup egg rolls chow mein a beef dish and the boneless crispy fried chicken. 

The wonton broth was SO light and delicious no scum or floaties talk about quality and the wontons were nice and light. 

Egg Roll was properly fried and not greasy.  Same with the chicken.

The other dishes came with nice fresh vegetables and were great portions exactly what I would expect. 

Left extremely satisfied with leftovers for the next day. Will be back for sure!"
"This place sparks my interest due to the lineup. Adding to our excitement was the live demonstration of chefs pulling noodles dough to the size of choice the traditional way.

We were there Monday night 7.30pm and there were 5 people ahead of us. In total me and wife waited for 15 minutes.

We ordered Dan Dan and special lan zhou noodless both small size - decent for one. As guidance: I'd say their medium size bowl would fill up two and large would fill family of three.

The noodless are the star of the show - springy but not hard far from soft tasty. Nothing like I ever tasted in my whole life.

Dan Dan noodles was nicely seasoned excellent balance of meat quantity and cilantro. The meat sticks as you mix the ingredients together. Simply 10 out of 10.

Soup was tasty rightly seasoned perfectly spicy... and doesn't leave tingly feeling at the end like other msg enduced instant noodles. Not inferring a comparison just giving a clear picture. In short - exceptional.

Best choice in Montreal Chinatown top noodles place of my life.

As bonus grocery store right beneath provide a good selection of snacks afterwards."
The line to purchase took longer than I would have liked and moved slowly.  Beef was quite tough and chewy and the noodless seemed slightly undercooked and soup wasn't very flavorful.  Overall was disappointed by the meal and would probably choose to eat elsewhere next time.
"ove this place even though the spicy level could be better.. but the presentation and the beef was delicious as well as the side. Get the combo 1 although I really want to go back to try the other noodless.
Value 5/5
Atmosphere 5/5
Service 5/5
Quality 4/5
19/20"
Came here to escape the cold. The service was no frills. The food was good. We got the DanDan noodless and the beef tendon noodless. The noodless were nice and chewy and super fresh.
"Great Pho place. The service was rude but the food will have us coming back :)

The rare beef+well done brisket was on e of the best I've tasted in Montreal.

I also tried the meat and vegetable one and it was really  good; vegetables were nicely grilled while still crunchy :) yum."
I work nearby so this noodles place is a huge hit for me and my coworkers. They have freshly pulled noodless which they pull at the front of their restaurant if you're looking for a little show before your meal. I've only ever tried their lan zhou pulled noodles which you can get in a couple of different sizes (small med large or xl) and you can choose to get a spicy broth (which is the same broth they use for the non spicy but they add some chili oil). Comes with a few slices of thinly sliced beef coriander and turnip. The broth is very tasty and the noodless are also quite good. I have also tried their spicy cucumber salad which is topped with crushed peanuts (so avoid if you have allergies!) I am giving this place only 4 stars because it is quite small so once all the seats are filled you have to wait outside (or get it to go). Also the quality of the cucumber salad has its good days and days where its just ok. But the pulled noodles soup is great so that is worth trying here!
"I just realized I haven't written any on this restaurant. I am a pretty regular visitor usually once a week after a grocery shopping nearby.

As many pointed out the taste is great and the service is quick and the price is reasonable. Pho (rice noodles) is a must-go menu and I liked their Cum-sung (grilled pork with rice) a lot too. If you are new to try the Vietnamese noodles I dare advise you to start from simple meat not including any intestines. The meat options are not necessarily to be ""well-done"" ""rare"" might be more soft and will be cooked anyway with the hot broth especially if you prefer medium or medium rare steak. 

You might not expect kind service explaining all the menu or recommendation. Usually its quite busy and packed with people and I experienced once like the order was missed - so I had to remind the server and wait for a long time. However this could be possible as I visited there may be more than 50+ times as well as usually very busy. 

Strongly recommend not super strong for the beginner but still keeping the authentic dish with reasonable price and service."

Ambience: 3*

Had an early dinner after wandering Montreal. We had hot and sour soup Imperial Shrimp Kung Pao chicken and Thai crispy noodless with seafood. The shrimp dish had ample shrimp but was bland. Once we added some soy sauce and chili oil it was good. Kung Pao was okay again under-flavored. The crispy noodles dish was a star good flavor and great texture contrasts between the juicy seafood and crispy noodless. The hot and sour soup was the bomb. Well seasoned well flavored and just the right amount of spice. We ordered the house red (picture attached) it was good and tasty.

We would return when in the area again."
"uhhhhhhMAZING!!!! 

BYOB and eat drink and be merry at this excellent cafe. The lemongrass beef noodless is just awesome. The general tso's chicken is great! Just great great food! you will not be sorry. Service is great vibe is fun and lively. Fabulous time!"
Beautiful decoration and yummy vegan food. Service people are super friendly and you feel welcomed. Overall a great experience.
"Really nice food very generous helpings courteous and friendly staff. Overall a great little place! 

The soup dumplings were especially tasty!"
The most flavourful and delicious soup ever and the noodless? Hhmmmmmmmm!!!!! Can't wait to go back.
Great noodles bowl in a cold city on a snowy day! Although it's in a mall - well worth it!
This is the best Vietnamese food we've ever had. Even the won ton soup was so good we ate every drop - who does that with won ton soup? The sauces are light and fresh and flavorable and the vegetables are plentiful. We'd go back here in a heartbeat!
This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Montreal. Every dish is flavorful and the employees provide great service.
Great hot 'n sour soup! They also offer general tao tofu which is pretty damn good. The noodless are just ok.
Its good enough for me for last minute nibble. Many tables smile service. Many choices. Fast.
"Great place for Bun Bo hue. For those who are not experienced in BBH it's a spicy beef noodles soup in a rich broth. Think of it as Pho's angrier cousin. Rich beef broth with noodless and a healthy spicy kick to it. Another way I can explain BBH is it's quite possibly the best way to clear a full sinus cavity. Thus it makes a delicious meal in the cooler months where we have those wet humid 0C to -10C days. You know the days I'm talking about.......where you feel chilled to the bone and you feel like curling up under a blanket or blasting the heat just to warm up. Go get a steamy bowl of Bun Bo Hue and PRESTO. Instant feel better. 

For those who are Vietnamese purists this is a delicious option in a town where Vietnamese food is plentiful. Absolutely I shall be back. Without a question. 

****** Word of caution. BBH is not a first date meal. It is only if you state ground rules that you eat like a hungry dog. 

****** Second word of caution. Don't wear a white shirt as those red oil stains (from the soup) are near impossible to get out. I made an impromptu bib out of paper towel (yes I'm comfortable in my own skin). 

Slurp it up. MEGA delish in every way!"
Horrible service we waited 45 minutes and only had one tapa served. Other people who were seated after us got their food before us. We left after an hour of waiting they have no real chairs only stools that are ver very u comfortable. Trust me the food is not worth the terrible service is hot and terrible stools.
One of the most pleasant dining experiences I've had! Food was delicious service was great drinks were tasty
Good Italian food and nice service . Should be there soon. Maybe this month. Be sure to try it!
Great Yelp review drew us to the noodles factory. homemade noodless were first class had it mixed with vegetables and tofu. The Chinese broccoli sautee was absolutely first-class and the steamed vegetable dumplings were a little bit on the  doughy side but tasty. For Montreal food prices it was a steal.. good quality fast service. I would definitely return
"If you can score a table for a bowl of this soup do it.

It's small cramped and usually busy. 

You may have to wait a few.

It's okay. It's worth it.

Everyone is there for the same reason - to eat those bowls of steamy soup made with hand pulled noodless.

Before you enter you get an inkling of the goodness to come - the guy in the window is painstakingly and expertly working a hunk of dough into thin strands of fresh soup noodless. Over and over.

There are only a few items to order. Get the Lanzhou special soup.

A medium is plenty for most and probably more than enough for some.

The slighly spicy cucumber salad is a perfect accompaniment to those big bowls of broth.

Slurp. Repeat. Wipe your forehead and do it again.

5 stars."
"We ordered 3 things wonton soup General Tao chicken and orange beef. What we got was dough in liquid chicken skin/fat in fried dough and more skin/fat in dough.

The wonton was literally rolled dough with barely any meat if any inside. I took a bite and you can see the dough rolled. From my experience wonton is supposed to be dough surrounding a piece of meat.

The general Tao was pieces of chicken fat or chicken skin or just plain fried dough.

Same thing with the orange beef.

I just paid 45$ for fried dough chicken skin/fat & beef fat don't think there was any meat in my order.

I'm never going to step foot in that restaurant!"
I like the people working there so sweet! We even got a soup on the house. They made a mistake with our order (put beef instead of chicken - so maybe be careful to double check your order) but the food was great and quite tasty and they gave us a free dish the next time because of their mistake the previous time so their customer service is very good! Also with the limited options for tasty authentic asian food in Montreal (at least compared to Markham where I'm originally from) I'm always happy to find another good restaurant to add to my list of options.
"I got the dandan noodless which were loaded with peanuts and cilantro. My friend got the beef noodles soup which I also tried. In general I don't think you can go wrong here! Both dishes were hearty and filling and I really liked the cucumber salad that mine came with. 

Because we got there right when the restaurant opened we didn't have any trouble with getting seated. I can definitely see how that could be a problem if we came at a busier hour though. The storefront is really small and the tables are extremely limited. The food is worth it though!"
Very good authentic Cantonese food affordable in Chinatown. I'm from Los Angeles and drove more than 2hrs from Ontario and we went straight here to this Cantonese restaurant bcz my grandma loves Chinese food. We ordered Fish  congee fujian noodles king mushroom fish snow peas black pepper beef . The chef cooking style is super authentic (Hong Kong style) wok style cooking
"I am in love with Satay Brothers. They are the popular kids on the block. They are spicy yet cool! I love their satay curry noodles soup with chicken braised pork belly and great beers. I'm not yet finished with my food but I already want seconds; damn the line is too long now! Don't miss Satay Brothers."
"If you want sandwiches and soup the ingredients are extremely fresh the portions are huge and the prices are reasonable.  3 things you don't find together very often.

We sat on the outdoor patio because the weather was excellent.  I started with the spicy carrot-apple puree soup... something I was unsure about at first but it sounded better than the vegetable soup.  It turned out to be delicious.  I followed this up with the ""Pepper Island"" sandwich with pesto cream cheese chicken salad and chopped peppers (a replacement for the missing jalapeno jelly).  Trust me when I say that mere mortals do not need a full sandwich portion if you get soup.  A half portion should be plenty and you will not hate yourself afterwards.

Wash it all down with one of their special soda floats.  I went with the maple-spice soda float.  I felt like I was drinking soda water that had been hypersaturated with maple sugar infused sugar and topped with a scoop of ice cream.  It was amazing.

-1 star for generally slow inattentive service.  Perfect if you want to laze about and study textbooks (which many were doing) but if you actually have a timetable it's kind of annoying.  The food is amazing here so just come mentally prepared."
Simply great food.  Service is great and everything was delicious.  We had #10 fried dumplings and the imperial rolls for starters.  General Tao Chicken had a very favorable sauce.  Spicy pork and vegetable soup was excellent but if you want it really spicy just add some of the hot sauce in the container at the table.
An upscale Pho restaurant that serves a limited menu. Crowded during the lunch hour but empties after 1pm. Outdoor and indoor seating. The prices are high here--$17 for the beef Pho. The broth is decent but not the richest I've had by far. They also don't serve it in a customizable fashion. There was just a couple basil leaves in mine and far more bean sprouts than I would add. No lemon to squeeze in. The noodless were also non standard rice noodless-- they were flat and about the thickness of fettuccini. That's important because the usual thin noodless retain lots of broth as you left them from the soup. Wider flat noodless don't. The beef on the other hand was superb. Tender and flavorful. The service was also fast and friendly.
"After months of searching I finally got to try an authentic noodles soup with a vegetarian broth thanks to Aruns review.
I would always be so tempted by the delicious waft of a warming soup bowl from the various places downtown filling the air but whenever inquiring on whether their vegetarian soup bowl uses an actual vegetarian broth I would get a negative answer. 

By chance I happened to pass by Nouilles de Lan Zhou one bitter-cold Friday evening. It was absolutely freezing (-22) and despite not being hungry we needed a place to quickly warm up so we could continue to our destination. Seeing the fresh noodless being hand made in front of my eyes through the restaurant window I was pulled in and decided to order a small vegetarian noodles soup to try. It was my first time at such a place and I was not accustomed to the ordering system. Thankfully the server was extremely friendly and guided me through the ordering process. He explained all the noodles types and thicknesses and confirmed that the broth was vegetarian. As we were eating in he also brought us each a small cup of hot green tea.

Within 5 minutes my order arrived and I was instantly taken aback by the portion size! The bowl was huge for a small-size and I wasn't even hungry! Still however I managed to gobble it down and enjoyed it very much with the chilli oil. The flavours were very fresh and the noodless were perfect.

The interior is very basic with cramped seating in a very small space. There is also an escalator leading down to a grocery store which I found very unusual and random. If it was closer I would probably grab a takeaway as I wasn't too comfortable inside. However still a great first- time experience - will definitely be back"
"There are easily 10 other Vietnamese restaurants on the same street but this was one of the two places that had a line up on Saturday night. (The other place was pho bang New York) 

Service is quick. 

I ordered the basic regular pho. $8.50 for a small and was just the right portion for me. 

The soup base was good. But it still lacks some depth of flavors that I've had at other pho places. The noodless were spot on. And they are not stingy with the beef!!"
"Shrimp toast - Great
Salt Shrimp - Ok
Wonton Soup - Questionable
Singapore noodless - Horrid

Crazy range of quality across the menus."
Authentic Lanzhou noodles. Worth the wait! Besides the noodless menu the side dishes are amazing.
Oh man the bbq pork soup is stellar. Perfect broth pork noodless and greens. Seriously great for a food court.
"You're stuck in the Canadian winter and looking for something to warm you up? Count on my words a bowl of Pho soup will be your best friend 

Today I passed by Sen Vang .. A tiny place which is located just in front of Metro Côte-Ste-Catherine (you can't miss it out! they have a big green billboard lol). I ordered a beef bowl of Pho. The ingredients are fresh the meat is super tender and just the smell of if will make you salivate.

The service was fast.. Price including tax was about 10$.. The only advise I'd give you they only accept payments by ""cash""

Et bonne appétit!"
Delicious!!! The service is super friendly and welcoming and they master vietnamese specialties like bun bo hue. A must try!!
The injera was paper thin with no flavor.  Veggie combo was utterly too salty especially the potato & carrots.  Beef tibs were ok but nothing to write home about.  Edible but really mediocre food with non-existent service.  I might have been really badly spoiled in Seattle with really good Ethiopian food but this place was just so disappointing.
good food and fast service. I ordered vermicelle bowl with veggies pork chicken and an imperial roll everything in it is flavourful even the carrot is pickled and tastes really good except the rice noodles is a bit dry and has no flavour... But it'll be alright if u pour enough fish sauce&hot sauce on it!
"With so many pretenders to the Tonkin soup throne in Montreal every one has their favourite Pho place right? Here's why this is yours. 

The breadth and depth of the stock is what sets Tay Ho apart. It's meaty and marrowy with no trace of the false kick of MSG that so often mars that of other establishments. Served with a beautiful arrangement of thai basil bean sprouts and lime wedges you can season the basic meat broth noodles combo to your taste. 

For grilled meat enthusiasts there is also a remarkable (and huge) pork bun dish with the rare beef salad also a must."
"Had dinner with a friend last night;   The food was tasty enough but dishes had to be returned to be re-heated.  The service was slow; seemed like more training for the staff would be in order.  Our server did try his best & and we were extremely patient with his lack of experience.
A lack lustre experience from a service standpoint............"
Delicious southeast Asian food the best I have had in North America.  Owner and family in the restaurant taking care of guests as if they were his own family.  Great experience - sort of wish I Iived next door to this place.  Try the sate soup and one of the noodles dishes.  And bring your own wine or beer!
"If you want authentic real Chinese food come here! You hear that from a chinese from Montreal!

From seafood to popular sweet and soul porc XO sauce sauté beef or full salt cooked chicken. You can't go wrong!

In real Chinese restaurant don't expect A Class service they put the focus on the food quality.

Price is fair quality makes it worthwhile."
Come here with my family and son's room mate when we visit my son at university this weekend whole family and son's friend love it. Good Cantonese food fast service good chinese prices. Basic but clean whole restaurant use plastic tablecloth. Best food we had in Montreal Chinatown delicious Shanghai stir fry noodles and jook much better than other more expensive restaurants.
"After watching them make noodless in the window earlier in the day we had dinner here last night. Upon being seated the waiter said they have one thing; three sizes and spicy or not.  Good thing we were looking for that one thing!  We both ordered the small which is a good portion size and some appetizers.  The apps the mushrooms and eggs were good.  Soon after we were brought two piping hot bowls of delicious noodles soup.  The broth was quite good and the beef contrary to one of the Yelp reviews was just fine.  (This isn't fine dining.)  The noodless and overall spicing and flavor was excellent.  It was perfect for what we wanted for dinner.  I would recommend it if you are looking for a great bowl of soup."
"If only I could give this place zero star. I literally just got done eating from here and I have to say the servers were RUDE! The first server was upset because I said I wasn't ready to order so she walked off(started speaking Chinese) and have the guy come take our order. Then I asked to substitute shrimp for chicken and he wasn't happy. He looked annoyed even when my boyfriend asked for a brisk tea. Horrible customer service. 

For food it was also horrible. The pork belly was very bland and the noodles was also bland. I usually pack leftover but I didn't even bother. The sweet and sour soup also tasted water down. I can understand why they are so slow bad food and horrible customer service. I wouldn't recommend anyone to come eat here. We were the only customers(then finally saw two customers walked in).

Lastly when I paid upfront. He had the nerve to tell me that tips wasn't included so I told him tips is on the table. I am not a bad tipper I usually tip well but sorry for services that bad he deserved the tip I left for him. Yes it was even less than 15%. For someone to provide me this horrible service shouldn't even get anything in the first place."
The man hand making the long noodless in the window and the long line led us to this fun noodles place on Chinatown. We stood in line for 45 minutes but was rewarded with big wonderful bowls of handmade noodless. He had spicy dan dan noodless (no broth) and I had the beef broth with veggies and beef.  Do add the tea egg!  We each got a Small size and it was plenty. We still had leftovers. The medium is enough for two.  This was a fun place and moderately priced.
"If you need hot spicy soup then come here. You get to choose the kind of noodless you want based on width The servings are huge a medium will stuff you silly so don't even go for a large. Between the meat and the noodless some veggies this is I guess Chinese fast food and much much better than McDonald's. 
Still this is not a place to linger for a very long people usually walk in order the soup get in within a minute or two slurp it all up and leave The staff are young service is very brisk and I'd say there's a very utilitarian mindset and ethos here."
"This place is tiny but boy is the food GOOD. Their menu only has 4-5 different noodles dishes which might not seem great but it means that they know how to make it right. Nothing's too spicy and they even let you pick the size of noodless you want. Def going back again!

Now I know what you might be thinking: tiny place + chinese resto...here comes the rant about how awful their service is bla bla. No. Calm down. Their service was actually great. The waiter was super friendly and had a sense of humor. He even gave us two free side dishes because our order was taking longer than expected (we didn't even realize it was delayed).

Recommend"
We were wandering through Montreal's Chinatown just after the lunch rush on New Years Eve 2018.  Came across this place with mixed reviews and decided to give it a try.  We ordered the orange beef and vegetarian hot pot.  It's a no frills place and we were one of only three tables occupied at that time.  But the food was really good service was fast and we left there satisfied.  Of particular note was the batter on the orange beef - it was so light and crispy.  Much better than the average Chinese takeout.  Give this place a try.
"Good food the presentation for the dessert ones are really cute and fun.

Fast friendly service yet again in Montreal! !"
Great food at a decent price lots of fun cocktails great ambiance. Service might be a little slow when it gets busy.
Great food great service. Seafoods are fresh and reasonable price. It's on a second floor in the central of China town.
Food was excellent and the service was fast. Make sure to reserve in advance. The restaurant is tiny !
Friendly service and delicious vegetarian dumplings! The inside is beautiful and conveniently located beside the concordia library building!
Great service fun drinks (in the sweet side) really great food! The Fried broccoli were delicious and memorable!
"I absolutely love this place. The service the ambiance and most
 of all the food is great.  Everything is super fresh and amazingly tasty

I recommend it and cant wait to return

Try the lemon with coconut drink. The veggie platter.  That spongy bread is sooo good.  i loved everything i ordered

Service was really nice"
If you want quick Chinese food this is the place to go. We were seating immediately and placed our orders within 5 minutes. Our food came out roughly 10 minutes after. Fast service is definitely one of selling points here. We ordered the Cantonese chow mein shrimp fried rice pan fried pork dumplings and spring rolls. Decent food and quick service.
"I would highly recommend visiting this place! Their noodless are delicious and there are so many kinds you can choose from. It's a fun experience being in the restaurant too because they make the noodles in an open style kitchen where you can see it. 

For their main noodles menu you can choose the shape and thickness of the noodles. I found thinner noodless better than thick ones but you can really cater it to your preference! 

The only downside is that the place is small and cramped so if you're going on a busy day/time there will most likely be a wait."
"The food is good and the portion is generous. I recommend to everyone. One of the best choice for Thai food in Montreal. I recommend to ordering the tasting menu.

Beware you won't finish your meal. Two salads and appetizers plus soup are a lot (the tom yum soup was delicious!). I could not finish my main dish."
"Excellent food price and service.

Try taking several dishes and share with everyone at your table! You won't regret it."
I took the menu of the day. Kung Pao Chicken and Won Ton soup. It was cheap and good.
"Highly recommended! Everything was so good and great service! 
My favorites the spiced calamars and the yuca chips!"
Tried this place as my group was touring Montreal for a few days from Toronto. Our group was all Chinese with local Chinese Torontonians and a few Shanghainese. The place was very busy for lunch as the location is good. It is only a short walk from old Montreal and located on the Main Street of Montreal Chinatown. The service is relatively good but the food is just ok. There is really nothing so memorable. The noodless are truly hand pulled with the noodles maker making noodless in the front window. The soup itself is ok but nothing so great. As a comparison the Vietnamese pho shops generally have better quality broths and tastier noodles soups. The prices are around CAD$10 for a large bowl. When I return to Montreal next time I will try other places as this one was not memorable.
"This small restaurant can get line ups going out the door my friends and I were lucky enough to get a table right when we stepped foot inside. You can see the noodless being hand-pulled right in front of your eyes from the store front window.

Food: Got their Braised beef tendon with noodless ($10.99). The thickness of noodless can be changed. The soup was clear and simple my tongue could not detect a distinct flavour but the chilli oil did add some taste. The highlights of the bowl was the noodless radish slices and tender melt-in-your-mouth beef tendons. 

Service & atmosphere: Seating is slightly cramped but that just adds authenticity to the shop. The entrance of an underground asian market is housed inside the restaurant so after you are full from your noodless you Jocan walk it off in the market.

Price: I am sure you can get this bowl of noodless from China for a cheaper price. However the price is fair as it is the only hand-pulled noodles shop in Montreal that I know of."
"handmade noodless with your option to chose circle/flat and various ranges of size to chose from. the soup is light but great to cure that hangover and/or just in the mood for some great authentic noodless.

the combo is great- you get an option of the cold/spicy cucumber cold seaweed & potato or a third option that i didn't even pay attention to.  we also got an order of the cold spicy beef which was great to share among 6 of us.

the great thing about this place is the ability to chose your noodles size shape and spice level. word of advice go less spicier b/c you can always add more spicy oil. the small is almost like a regular size but plenty of people were wolfing down the medium sized bowl (which was almost as big as their face)

the place is small so go as a group of 4 max unless you expect to wait until the long table/ledge is open. the service is eh however come for the soup and hand pulled noodless."
"We ordered the corn chicken soup and the shrimp in XO sauce. The soup was sweet and delicious and tasted very authentic - we really felt it was warm and comforting. The shrimp in XO sauce was decent with a little kick but nothing to write home about. Our meal came with tea which we really enjoyed as well.

The interior is older but feels like a hole in the wall which I appreciate. The service is pretty typical for an authentic Chinese restaurant and ordering is done by writing down your items on a order slip after you sit down."
"The food is great and they have affordable prices. The ambiance is very cozy. The only thing that I'm not crazy about is the service. The service staff is pretty slow and don't seem to be happy to be there.

Very vegetarian and vegan friendly."
Straightforward Cantonese style fast food. Food is fresh and seasoned well like what we're used to in NYC. We ordered the soup dumplings chicken Li menu Singapore chow mei fun and general Tso's chicken. Nothing fancy just good. I have them an extra star for the good service and for inviting the lion dancers in for good luck!
"The place is super simple and easy going and super busy but a must do stop ... China town needs a visit and so this place. Ordered the meat noodles soup no spicy and it was very nice. If you like a bit of spicy the ""spicy"" version is the one to order. To be back."
"I went this summer overall good experience. I'd definately go back with my gf. The atmosphere is fun the food is very good and the prices are very reasonable. 

I just hope they improve on service. Service was a little slow and they had switched waiters on us without us knowing which was a little confusing apparently they were short staffed that night... could happen."
"I have been to this place a few times over the past few years. I love the food here and considering the demand prices are still good. Chinatown is packed with of course great options to eat out but this restaurant has earned its reputation of being one of the best ones in the town so you can see by the line up outside. Anyway I always come here for their beef tranch fries... Its not really listed in the menu but you can always ask the waiter for salt and pepper beef with no sauce or even customize any dish. Really. They have a potluck service going on so everyone is always helping your table not matter what and you wont feel left behind at all. I loved how my particular who made a point on smiling and nodding everytime he passed and asked if everything was okay making sure he was attentive. And this happens consistently everytime I come here any given time. 

The food itself is great! As a regular I always get the beef that I was talking about the corn chicken creamy soup and 2 sides that I always change around. One of my fav here is the cantonese fried chowmein. Its crispy with enough chicken around. 

Overall its great here to come check out after your done sight seeing chinatown or down walk from st laurent street :)"
This is quite a find.  We had the zha-jiang noodles combo and the dan and dan noodles.  Both were delicious.  The place is cramped and it's hard to bring a large group in.  However the noodless are made to order and the food is wonderful.  I highly recommend a visit.
"Unusually nicer and cleaner interior at Pho Tay Ho as a Vietnamese eatery.

There isn't much talking between a waiter and you since all you need to do is to select your order on an order form and voilà within a minute food come out to your table nice and hot!

Bun Bo Nuong Cha Gio - Grilled lemongrass beef spring rolls vermicelli noodless pickled carrot vegetables piles of Thai basil mint leaves & cilantro crushed roasted peanuts and nuoc mam(fish sauce) all were barely fit for the bowl! Smoky and sweet flavor I LIKE!  This restaurant is generous with its portions: piles of thick cut grilled beef was very satisfying with a bunch of - literally a bunch! - cilantro Thai basil and mint. I'm sure you will love it too if a herb lover like me.

Pho Dac Biet - Pho with rare and cooked beef beef balls tendons and tripe. Thai basil sprouts and two little Thai chili peppers crushed by my big spoon into my soup; OMG it was one wonderful meal! Not the best broth compared to Pho Lien but the rice noodless had unusual great texture; lots of basil & mint leaves & hot chili peppers are given to tables; the portion of meat was just enough; and most of all the place was nice and clean plus recently renovated along with new tables and chairs! 9.5/10 LOL!"
"Living California all my life I've had some good pho and Bun Bo hue (spicy beef noodless soup); therefore my expectation for this place wasn't too high before the foods came out. 
We ordered well done and rare pho and the BBH (spicy noodless soup) and to my surprise the pho broth was very tasty! The BBH bowl came out with the lemongrass and sate aroma! It is also spicy to my liking. 
The regular bowl is fairly large but if have a hefty appetite the large will keep you full for a day! Definitely recommend this place!"
"Smallish placemodernspare decor complete with a fake fireplace and exposed brick walls. We were a party of 4 in for late lunch and started with a cold fungus and coriander saladvery tastyfollowed by another cold dish of spicy Schecwan beef noodless.This was tasty as wellbut the beef was nothing but grizzle. Third order was pan-fried veggie dumplingsvery goodfollowed by an order of pan-fried chicken/coriander filled dumplings....delicious!
We then proceeded with the last dish orderedcrispy pancakes;essentially a crispy pancake stuffed inside an omelette... tasty with a touch of spice. All in allvery good with prompt service.Only complaint...tea was warm."
"First time trying hand made noodless--won't be my last time. Very delicious.
They only have a few options here but they are all solid. Very small kitchen and tight seating. But you come here for the delicious food.
Very filling. I shared a Medium size noodles bowl with my sister and I was full for most of the day. 
You can choose your noodles size."
"Had the ""basic"" pho. Broth is way too salty and beef was average quality. There are better options in the area !"
"Authentic and awesome. 
Great rare beef pho. Add vegetables it's worth it. Fast and easy can't wait to return!"
